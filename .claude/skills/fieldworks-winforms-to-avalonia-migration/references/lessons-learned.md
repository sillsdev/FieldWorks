# Lessons Ledger and Skill-Update Protocol

The fieldworks-* migration skills only stay useful if every migration
updates them. This file defines (a) the routing table that maps each kind
of discovery to the exact place to record it, and (b) an append-only ledger
of migration retrospectives so future agents can see how the skill set
evolved and why.

## Update protocol — where each discovery goes

Run this at the end of every migration (workflow step 10 in SKILL.md), and
immediately whenever you hit a stale pointer mid-task. Make the edits in
the same PR as the migration.

| You discovered… | Update |
| --- | --- |
| A new architectural pattern, or a refinement of an existing one | `architecture-patterns.md` — add/extend the numbered section (decision, why, canonical code, gotchas); add a row to the SKILL.md quick map if it is load-bearing |
| A new seam contract | `seam-catalog.md` §1/§2 plus its pivot trigger in §3 |
| A pivot trigger fired (decision re-evaluated) | Record the outcome inline in `seam-catalog.md` §3 and summarize in the ledger below |
| A new plugin for a custom slice class | `architecture-patterns.md` §5 canonical-code list; keep the burn-down test list current |
| A new gotcha / failure mode (interop, DPI, fonts, focus, threading, lifetime…) | The Gotchas paragraph of the matching `architecture-patterns.md` section; if it is a review smell, also add a red flag to the most relevant satellite skill |
| A new forbidden legacy symbol | `EngineIsolationAuditTests.cs` (the enforcement) and `parity-evidence.md` §4 (the documentation) — both in the same PR |
| A new evidence lane, artifact type, or evidence-language term | `parity-evidence.md` |
| A new mandatory step in the per-region process | `migration-checklist.md` (and the workflow list in SKILL.md if it is a new phase) |
| A trigger phrase that failed to invoke a skill when it should have | The `description` frontmatter of that skill — add the missing vocabulary; keep descriptions quoted (YAML colons) and third-person |
| A stale file pointer (file moved/renamed, openspec change archived) | Fix the pointer in whichever skill file holds it; prefer pointing at code and tests over change docs |
| Updated performance baselines | `DataTreeTimingBaselines.json` stays the source of truth; update budget notes in `parity-evidence.md` §5 only if the policy (not the numbers) changed |

Rules of thumb:

- **Skills point, references explain, openspec records provenance.** Do
  not paste large doc content into skills; capture the durable decision and
  point at code/tests, citing the openspec doc as provenance.
- **Generalize before writing.** Record the class of problem, not the
  one-off instance. If it only applies to one region, it goes in that
  region's openspec change, not here.
- **Prune as you add.** If a section no longer pays for its tokens
  (pattern superseded, gotcha fixed at the framework level), delete or
  collapse it. Skills are working memory, not an archive — the archive is
  git history and openspec.
- **Keep SKILL.md bodies under ~150 lines** and references one level deep
  from SKILL.md. If a reference outgrows ~300 lines, split it by domain
  and update the pointers.

## Ledger

Append one entry per completed migration (newest first). Keep entries to
~10 lines: link to the change, what was migrated, what was learned, which
skill files changed.

### 2026-06 — Lexical Edit (full entry view), phases 1–2 (seed entry)

- Change: `openspec/changes/lexical-edit-avalonia-migration/` (plus
  `avalonia-migration-roadmap`, `lexical-edit-avalonia-poc-spike`).
- Migrated: first Avalonia lexical-edit region — typed IR pipeline, region
  composer, owned field controls (`FwMultiWsTextField`, `FwOptionPicker`,
  menus/flyouts), plugin registry, surface selection service, seam
  contracts, Path 3 parity harness.
- Key lessons now encoded: boundary above DataTree (don't extract
  internals); owned dense controls over stock grids; explicit
  unsupported rows over silent fallback; one global undo stack; WinForms
  dialogs own all modality during coexistence; measured (not estimated)
  performance budgets; StringTable + `.resx` dual localization lanes;
  `<RootNamespace>` required for Crowdin satellite builds.
- Skill set restructured (this commit): skills moved from
  `.github/skills/` to `.claude/skills/` per AI_GOVERNANCE no-mirror rule;
  hub skill rewritten with references/ (architecture-patterns, seam-catalog,
  parity-evidence, migration-checklist, this ledger); satellite skill
  descriptions rewritten for triggering; fixed YAML-colon bug that broke
  `fieldworks-ui-wiring-review` triggering.
