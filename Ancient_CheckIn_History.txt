This file, CheckIn_Process.txt, and CheckIn_History.txt are used to manage the
FieldWorks check-in process, and also to record a history of the changes made to the project.

Please read CheckIn_Process.txt for details on how to check changes in to Perforce.

Changes that are less than two months old can be found in CheckIn_History.txt.

Here begins the old check-in history:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JohnT, Jun-4-01. Added initial version of CheckIn-History.txt file, with instructions.
KenZ, Jun-5-01. Added FullWindow changes from Darrell in Cle/Notebk, and moved
	RnAnalysis_ExternalMaterials to RnGenericRecord_ExternalMaterials
SharonC, Jun-5-01. Added ability to drag-and-drop files onto WorldPad.
TomB, Jun-6-01. Made Format, Style work in WLC. Changed Style dialog to use style sheet of
	current root box instead of the default stylesheet for the language project. Warning:
	this involved a change to the interface of RootBox.
KenZ, Jun-6-01. Fixed problem with UserViewField_IsCustomField always being true. Load/Save
	had problems.
SteveMc, Jun-6-01.  Fixed getting language encodings connected to the database for persistence,
	both on input and output.  Also, the formatting toolbar combobox updates properly for
	new language encoding definitions.
Bammel, Jun-7-01.  Add class DebugWatch to provide for custom display of objects in the Watch
	window and in the Debugger Output window.
KenZ, Jun-7-01. Cleaned up AfDeFeRefs and associated files.
BurgettR, June-8-01  Work on Custom fields, however there are known problems, the work is
	not done.  Also corrected Hungarian for UserViewFields m_IsCustomField and IsNewFld.
BurgettR, June-11-01  Custom fields.
TomB, Jun-12-01. Added ability to load atomic back references. Added AnalyzedTextObjects as a
	sequence to StTextPara.  Added ParaCharOffset and VerseRef properties to
	TxtWordformInContext.  Partially implemented capacity to store and retrieve "Extra" info
	with a relationship.  Modified WLC to try to load WfiWordforms and persist concordance
	info in the TxtWordformInContext table. WLC still doesn't work right.

	root box that doesn't contain any view boxes.
BurgettR, June-12-01  Custom fields.
JohnT, June-13-01. Fixed various bugs to get the WLC app working again after the changes
	made last week. Enhanced OleDbEncap to give useful error messages when available;
	they should appear in the debug window.
SteveMc, Jun-14-01.  New Language Project seems to be working now.  Also added some simple
	command line processing for choosing a database (and server).  Moved the Debug / Open
	menu commmand to File / Open Language Project.
JohnT, Jun-15-01. Fixed the long-standing problem with editing filters, and a memory leak
	associated with displaying filters involving possiblity list items.

	files, and removed subentries from tools...options/views.
SteveMc, Jun-18-01.  Implemented File / Load Language Project by stealing code from the Explorer
	program, copying it to AppCore and modifying it to work in the general application
	framework.  (Explorer should probably be modified to use the new framework code.)

	the File / Open Language Project command dialog.
SteveMc, Jun-18-01.  Change the command line option for selecting a server (computer) from -s to

DavidO, Jun-19-01. Added a check to the beginning of AfCaptionBar::RecalcToolTip
	(in AfMainWnd.cpp) to determine whether or not there's an icon image list
	(m_himl == NULL). If there is not, control is return immediately. In certain
	circumstances, RecalcToolTip was getting called with no image list which
	causes an assert further down in the routine after the call to
	ImageList_GetIconSize.
SteveMc, Jun-19-01. Check in the latest help files, including adding two new help files for the
	List Editor and for WorldPad.
RandB, Jun-20-01. Lists of lists and hid Fields in combo of TlsOpt View Tab if onyl one item in

	This allows a caption bar between the concordance and draft views.
SteveMc, Jun-21-01.  Commented out the debug window stuff added by Stan Bammel for the
	StrBaseBufCore<XChar> template class.  Among other effects, this was causing
	Set<StrAnsiBufSmall> to incorrectly add data to the set.
RandB, Jun-22-01. Custom fields, Changes to the list editor and Poss Chooser to allow them to
	work with lists with no items.

	that don't understand XOR operations on pens.
TomB, July 3, 2001. Improved performance of ParseStTextPara by using CreateObj
	_TxtWordFormInContext$ to create TxtWordFormInContext entries with a single insert
	(performance is still a problem). Also got importing of books to place books in
	canonical order.

SharonC July-3-2001. Odds and ends.
SteveMc, July 5, 2001. Move DecodeMultiByte4 and DecodeMultiByte5 from Cellar/FwXmlExport.cpp to
	Generic/UtilString.  Also, allow secret symbol attribute for <Encoding24> inside
	<LgEncoding> to replace (or override) the <Integer> value on import, and write the
	symbolic value as a comment on export.
SteveMc, July 5, 2001. Change LgEncodingFactory::get_NumberOfEnc to return the total number of
	encodings defined either in the database or in memory (or both).  Change

JohnT, July 19, 2001. Improvements to Style dialog: only the relevant tabs appear; the set of
	styles that can't be renamed or deleted is reduced to "Normal" and "Default paragraph
	characters"; "Default paragraph characters" is listed (but can't be edited) so it can be
	applied; Character styles with no base style show as based on "default character style";
	default "next style" is the style itself; bullet and number toolbar buttons now perform
	hard formatting instead of selecting a style.

	buttons in the Options dialog to one.
SharonC, July 18, 2001.  Added File-Close item to WorldPad, removed Edit-Delete, fixed
	bugs related to default template.
TomB, July 18, 2001. Using stored procedures to retrieve "vernacular" wordforms for Scripture
	Concordance and to retrieve context info. Also, fixed bug that was causing AfLazyDeWnd
	to not be lazy in creating FieldEditors. Changed Concordance code to retrieve
	concordance back-pointers from WfiWordform only when needed to create a FieldEditor.
	Net effect is better performance, though some additional optimization is still needed.
	It is now possible (though still slow) to load large books without crashing.
KenZ, July 18, 2001. Added initial RnDeFeRoleParts field editor to handle roled participants.
JohnT, 19 July 2001. Got "default paragraph characters" to appear in the toolbar combo and

	implmentation of participants with roles.
SteveMc, July 20, 2001.  Set all of the DateCreated and DateModified values to the import date
	(and time) if these values are not given explicitly by the import data for both XML and

	items have either been attended to or made into postponed tasks, and all REVIEW items
	attended to or changed to ENHANCE. There is no known work that must be done in this
	subsystem before DN 1.0 ships. Also added error handling to VwRootBox, VwEnv, and
	VwNotifier.

	cosmetic and functional features. For example, the 3D top border of the caption bar
	can be enhanced. This also extends to the top of the AfHeaderWnd windows and when
	they have caption bars and/or column headings. I also added a feature to allow
	sizing caption bar owners by dragging the caption bar's top border up and down.

	menu for deleting a language project (database) to work.  This involved making sure that
	OleDbCommand objects are released before the OleDbEncap object that created them.
	Releasing the OleDbEncap object first results in the database connection staying live
	until the program exits.

DavidO, Sep 4, 2001, 12:04p. JohnT added several things to AfDeWnd and SE (formerly WLC) for
	selecting detail rows in the concordance. I also tweaked things a bit so the colors and

SteveMc, September 7, 2001.  New versions of the help files for Data Notebook and Topic/List
	Editor from Marlon.

	application subclass do it all. Update all apps (except WLC) to use this system.
RandB, Sept 18, 2001.  Fixed type ahead on toolbar combo boxes.
DavidO, Sept 18, 2001. Fixed an scripture importing bug in WLC.cpp. Was getting an assert in

RandB, Sept 21, 2001. Fixed many bugs, and resources for notebook and CLE.
TomB, September 24, 2001. Created new stored procedure for creating wordforms. Since all
	wordforms may not have their HVO's loaded in memory, we can't just create the new
	wordform unconditionally. This will avoid creation of duplicate wordforms in the
	database. Also fixed a couple problems with the visual aspect of inserting new
	wordforms in the concordance.

RandB, Sept 25,2001.  Fixed all places where "GetColValue" is called in the db using the wrong

SteveMc, October 2, 2001.  Fixed some filter bugs (RAID Bugs 1301, 1883 and 1886).

	updating rows about to be deleted.
JohnT, Oct 3, 2001. Fixed (parts of) 1252, 1763, 1775, and 1783.
TomB, Oct 3, 2001. Clean up Philemon to remove empty paragraphs and set Section references
	instead of paragraph references. Remove code in CustViewDa to retrieve Reference
	property of StTxtPara.
BryanW, Oct 3, 2001. Generalize AfStyleSheet so that in a special case it can have an owner
	such as Scripture, rather than the Language Project.
SteveMc, October 4, 2001.  Fixed help in wizard dialogs to allow separate help for the
	individual pages in the wizard.  This also should fix RAID Bug 1873.
SharonC, Oct 4, 2001. Fixed bugs 1601, 1607, 1032, 1668, 1681, and 1721, plus a small bug

	Restore.
DavidO, Oct. 5, 2001 Framework changes: Extended the AfCaptionBar class so it can be enabled to
	pass on mouse clicks to it's parent. Also allowed the border size, font and colors to
	be changed by the implementor. Extended the AfHeaderWnd class to use a subclassed
	caption bar so implementors of the header window class could control various properties
	of the header window's caption bar.
	WLC changes: Fixed problems with the proper windows in WLC not getting the focus when
	they should. Changed the color of selected concordance lines when the concordance window
	loses focus. It still looks selected but it has the 3D face background and button text
	foreground colors. Moved the creation and ownership of word status icons to the
	SeMainWnd. That way they're available to the entire application and won't get created
	for each ConcVC line in the concordance. Also added a set of word status icons for
	concordance lines that are selected but when the concordance window doesn't have focus.
	Fixed the problem where only head words were selected when using the keyboard to move up
	and down in the concordance window. Subclassed the concordance/wordlist view's caption
	bar so we could catch mouse clicks to deal with focus properly.

	to being able to import data into empty databases, or add data to existing databases.
RandyR, Oct 6, 2001. Add no frills message box support for reporting app startup problems found
	in command line and/or Registry. It does support retrying app start using default
	settings, however, where otherwise it would stop.
KenZ Oct 8, 2001. Replaced OCM codes in TestLangProj with thesaurus.
KenZ Oct 8, 2001. Removed OCM hlp files.

	paragraph layout.
RonMcG, Oct 10, 2001 - Enhanced display of Scripture References.
SteveMc, October 10, 2001.  Fixed makefiles to copy proper compiled help (.chm) files to the

	subitems also" flag (remnant of RAID Bug 673).

TomB, October 11, 2001. Updated Scripture data using new Title property of ScrBooks
TomB, October 11, 2001. Import enhancement - no longer look up book names in hash map; instead
	use book number to get hvoScrBookRef directly from vector in cache.
SharonC, October 11, 2001. Fixed a few bugs in Uniscribe engine and WorldPad hooks; cleaned
	up Language.dsp project file; fixed a bug in Graphite compiler related to default of
	boolean features.
RandB, Oct 11, 2001.  Fixed bug 1864.
SteveMc, October 11, 2001.  Fixed filtering on dates to show only the day, month, or year if

	2) Eliminated use of ScrRef table
	3) Loading Scripture data lazily
	4) Changed underlying approach to loading concordance data. Counts are now loaded along
	   with wordforms. No additional data needs to be loaded when scrolling in concordance.
	   When an item is expanded, twfic data is loaded. Paragraph contents are loaded lazily
	   (if the pertinent Scripture is not already loaded) when a particular detail line is
	   to be displayed.
	5) Removed model sanity checks from import stored procedures. These checks are now done
	   on start-up in debug-only code. Also, removed unneeded loop to try to set properties
	   for intermediate twfic and wordform objects in database since both objects are
	   derived directly from CMObject.
	6) Removed display of reference summary column (column still present, but no contents --
	   this decision needs to be finalized and the code needs to be ripped out if we don't
	   want it). Could do this on idle.
	Loading/saving user view specs from/to the database.

	Renamed several stored procedures to remove $-suffix.

	system color for window backgrounds should be used (i.e. ::GetSysColor(COLOR_WINDOW)).
DavidO, Nov 21, 2001, Added the ability to create a view selection on independent picture

	Systems dialog, and with deleting an active analysis encoding (RAID Bug 2141).
SteveMc, November 29, 2001.  Added links to the help file for popup dialogs in the Standard
	Format Import Wizard (RAID Bug 1873).

	parameter is null.
JonathanR, 12 Dec 2001. Added rowlock locking hints to DML statements that affect the

RandyR, 12 Mar 2002. Use only one GetPane method to get an AfSplitChild, rather than numerous

KenZ, 13 Mar 2002. Fixed *SP.sql files so they understand type constants.

JohnT, 1 Jul 2004. Better fix to TE-955 (commented out Rand's fix, which doesn't work right

SteveMc, July 6, 2004.  Fixed TE-1000 (Font rendering error in sections created via style
	change).  The description was very misleading.  The real issue is that Book Titles were
	being created in the UI (or Analysis?) writing system.  Also fixed TE-1006 (Spurious
	application of verse number style).  This was far more serious than the description
	suggests: it affected every program that uses the views DLL, and any style or formatting
	that begins a paragraph.
RandB, Kent July 7, 2004 TE-767  fixed
DanH-SteveMc July 7, 2004 Added Exception classes to DataConverter and made some mod's to

	test make file that this exposed.
SteveMc, July 13, 2003.  Fixed TE-942 (Footnote Text style changes depending on where the
	footnote reference occurs), at least the part not fixed by yesterday's TE integration.

	and the current facilities for printing in TE.

SteveMiller, 4 Nov 2004. Update unit test ut_Interlinear_fnGetDefaultAnalysesGlosses. FDB-65.
JohnT, 5 Nov 2004. Enhanced stored procedure for Goto_link dialog so it finds words where
	citation form matches even if word has no underlying form. But match must now be in
	correct writing system. Dealt with two cases where IText did not copy word gloss and POS
	from sense on monomorphemic words.
SharonC, 5 Nov 2004. Fixed bugs in Graphite related to zoom and printer-based DPI settings.
RandyR, 5 Nov, 2004. Fixed LT-545 "Don't search gloss field in Create Entry Box".
RandyR, 5 Nov, 2004. Add support to Linker to use server and database.
RandyR, 6 Nov, 2004. Fixed LT-748 "Go To doesn't handle non-Roman (e.g. Yi)".
JohnT, 8 Nov 2004. Enhanced IText paragraph parsing to detect words that have no annotations
	but whose form matches an allomorph in the Lexicon, and for which a default analysis
	as a monomorphmic word is therefore plausible. It thus effectively acts as a new
	'parsing agent', though we are not (yet) actually creating an annotation to identify
	the source of the analysis.
	This change affects the database (as did my last one), which is therefore updated to
	version 200012. To update 200011 databases you can use a script
	Upgrade200011To200012.sql from my dropbox (or if you can't get to that I can mail it to
	you).
SteveMiller, 8 Nov 2004. Add Ken's Data Migration update scripts.

SteveMiller, 9 Nov 2004. Fixed 200009To200010.sql.
JohnT, 9 Nov 2004. Fixed LT-770 (Simple edit view - don't add subsenses).
	DtMenuHandler.OnDataTreeInsert now looks for a new attribute "ownerClass" in the
	<command> element (see CmdDataTree-Insert-Entry-Sense in Lexicon/DataTreeInclude for an
	example).  The value is a class that the object must be inserted into. If the current
	slice's object is not of this class (or, even if this is not specified, if it does not
	possess the specified field), the hander now searches up the slice hierarchy for a
	containing object of the right class (or a subclass) having the proper field.
JohnT, 9 Nov 2004. Fixed LT-762 (crash returning to IText after deleting an entry which is
	used in a WfiAnalysis in the text). (Note however that it is still possible to delete
	entries that are used in an analysis...you just wind up with null slots in the
	analysis.)  Fixed LT-753 (now it is possible to paste into a slice view).
SteveMc, November 10, 2004.  Fixed LT-672 "<next> will not navigate past end of paragraph".
JohnT, 10 Nov 2004. Fixed DN-130 Add highlighting in Anthro Category sort.

SteveMc, November 12, 2004.  Fixed bug exposed by opening TE on a language project that didn't
	already have a scripture object, while LexText was already open.
SteveMc, November 12, 2004.  Fixed DN-396 "Initial space in new project name raises exception."
	by trimming names of leading and trailing spaces before creating the project.  Also
	fixed bug in the interlinear view Sandbox (setting Word POS was ignored unless either
	the Word Gloss or Lexical data was set).
RandyR, 13 Nov, 2004. 1) Switch linker code to use object's guid, rather than its database ID.
	2) Fixed LT-785 "external link to a different db not working".

	2. Updated LinguaLinks exporter and my ZPI data.
SteveMc, November 22, 2004.  Fixed LT-617 "Can't select top WfPOS <adjunct> without workaround".

	class names in environment strings) and LT-794 (Use natural class abbreviations and
	descriptions (as well as names) in the grammar sketch).  Modifed TestLangProj to
	distinguish between names and abbreviations in natural classes, too.
RandyR, 22 Nov, 2004. Fixed FindOrCreateWordform method to try lowering the case and look again,
	if it couldn't find the given input.

SteveMc, November 23, 2004.  Fixed LT-747 '"No Records" and "Sense" headings get stuck on'.

	In the morph sketch, added subsection under Residue which lists stems without POS.
	Also limited final appendix in the sketch to a specified number of items (like the other
	two appendices.)  Also added blurb about all or first X instances for subsections of
	first two appendices in sketch.  Streamlined how word grammar handles derivation outside
	of inflection.
SteveMc, November 23, 2004.  Fixed LT-75 "Deleting an infl affix slot does not properly handle
	any infl affix msas that refer to it" and DN-407 "Crash when deleting entry and subentry
	with open links".  Also cleaned up extraneous uses of DeleteObject$.

	machine friendly.  Can now build with "nant Teska".

SteveMc, November 30, 2004.  Fixed RemoveUnusedAnalyses$ to delete a maximum of 16 objects at a
	time, and fixed SIL.FieldWorks.WordWorks.Parser.ParseFiler.FinishWordForm() to use it in
	a loop.  This was all done to avoid timeout problems while preserving the usefulness of
	having a timeout.
JohnH, 30 Nov. LT-822 Locked down visibility of record list (treebar) for each tool.  LT-123
	"the data tree is loaded twice".

	handle case. (LT-1382, 1378, 788, 137) and LT-1377, loss of morpheme break characters
	when no lexical item is chosen.
	Had the currently usual teardown failure in TeDllTests and a similar one in

	Test failures occurred but don't appear to be related to our work:
	FwPrintLayoutComponentsTests;FxtDllTests;mkcel-tst;FootnoteViewTests;TeDllTests
	print layout and TeDll appear to be the usual problem deleting an un-closed root box.
	FXT is known to be broken.
	mkcel-tst is not reproducible (runs with no problems stand-alone).
	FootnoteViewTests is a tear-down Undo problem, also not reproducible.
JohnW, 31 Mar 2005. Implemented use of NUnit categories and marked some TE tests as
	"LongRunning" which will be skipped unless the "runAllTests" target is included in the
	build command line.

RandyR, 4 April, 2005. Fixed LT-"Add filter indicator to status bar", in part. "Filtered" now
	comes and goes, but it is not yellow, when it shows "Filtered", as in DN. The standard
	control does not support setting the background color, and it was too close to the end
	of April 4 to start making a new control.
JohnT/EricP, 4 Apr 2005. A number of IText enhancements
	(LT-851, LT-1305, LT-1340, LT-1381, LT-1388, LT-1389, LT-1390, LT-1399).

Johnw, 5 April. Integration from TE branch -> trunk
EricP, 5 Apr 2005. Fixed two Interlinear Text bugs created by our checkin
	changelists 12880 & 13005 on 03/18 & 04/04, respectively. The former addresses a crash
	(hopefully LT-1472) that occurs when the user tries to analyze a morpheme breakdown
	without (starting with) an existing stem analysis. The latter fixes a crash when
	the user tries to create a new entry for a word that has no WordPOS filled.

	unknown Unicode characters.  (KenZ found this while trying to import Yi strings in
	MultiBigString type fields.)
Hatton, April 9. LT-637 Importing an invalid file in Wordscope hangs LT.
	LT-1456 Parser doesn't really stop.
	LT-1508 FXT should not be sending bad environments to parser.

	Advanced Edit draws some initial invalid controls." (with help from JohnT)  Fixed
	LT-1519 "Certain morph types plus function crash".  Fixed LT-1520 "Right clicking on

Hatton, 11 April. Wired more of the parser to the green/yellow box system. Added some more
	logging around areas testers  are having trouble reproducing.

JohnT, 13 Apr 2005.
	LT-1098 - Problems auto-scrolling to show active child when laziness inserts new
		  controls in data tree
	LT-1523 - FDO fails to load basic data correctly when custom fields present
	LT-1516 - IText crashes if sandbox put on a wordform with empty form (in default vern

	of the DataTree for Lexicon/Advanced Edit draws some initial invalid controls".  Fixed
	LT-1133 "Green Screen Crash in Words-Concordance on filtered list".  Fixed LT-1141 "The

	resulting from editing in a line other than the last line, then moving elsewhere.
