<!--
  WARNING 1: Don't even think of not bumping up the version number,
	unless you are ONLY doing one, or more, of the following three exceptions.
	ALL other changes to this file REQUIRE a change of the 'version' attribute of the main "EntireModel" element
	to the next higher number.

	If the model changes do not require a formal data migration in the C# code, you MUST then add the 'do-nothing'
	data migration to the system in C#.
	The ONLY exceptions to incrementing the version number are:
	  1) Add/remove/modify optional <comment> and <notes> elements,
	  2) Add/remove/modify regular xml comments, and
	  3) Add stuff that only affects the code generator
		(e.g., optional singleton attribute added to class element and to the code generator)

  WARNING 2: You should be using a schema-aware editor, when you edit this file,
	or you run the risk of leaving it in a state where it becomes invalid.
	The schema this file is associated with is MasterFieldWorksModel.xsd,
	and it is in the same folder as this file.

   WARNING 3: Comments and notes within the model:
	These *must* follow the MS code documentation conventions, with the following exceptions:
	  1. Must be one or more <para> elements, and
	  2. <para> elements must not have newlines in them. (The build will likely fail, otherwise.)

The original version number was: 7000000. Be sure it has the right number of zeros after
editing it.

Change History: (Be sure to update the 'version' attribut in the EntireModel, when needed. (Almost always.))
  8 March 2012 (7000054): Added "ProcliticSlots" and "EncliticSlots" reference sequence properties to MoInflAffixTemplate.
	Also added "Slots" reference collection property to MoStemMsa. No data migration needed for this optional new capability.
	See LT-9137 "Allow proclitics or enclitics to be constrained by order".
  7 March 2012 (7000053): Added "Disabled" property to PhSegmentRule, MoCompoundRule, MoAdhocProhib, MoInflAffixTemplate.
	No data migration necessary because default is false (rule/template is Enabled/Active.)
	See LT-10471 "Allow user ability to turn phonological rules on or off".
  30 January 2012 (7000052): No actual model change but a data migration to copy all linked Morph Forms to their WfiMorphBundle Forms. See LT-12532: Retain the Form of a WfiMorphBundle even when fully analyzed.

	Modified Text to include a CmMediaContainer, and elminated the soundfilelocation attribute no significant migration should be required, the removed attribute
	is believed to have been unused.

  2 Febuary 2011 (7000036): Added DateModified to StText.
  31 January 2011 (7000035): No actual model change, this one triggers fixing un-owned footnote ORCs in vernacular Scripture.

	and put into the LangProject.PicturesOC collection which should only contain CmFolders.
  14 December 2010 (7000033): No actual model change, this one triggers fixing custom field refs in settings files.
  23 November 2010 (7000032): No actual model change, this one triggers moving settings to project folder.
  15 November 2010 (7000031): Removed all UserViews, UserViewRec, UserViewField from the DB
  10 November 2010 (7000030): Make externalLink's found in TsStrings a relative path for any files relative to LinkedFilesRootDir
	Also create a FilePathsInTsStrings element in LangProject which owns a CmFolder which owns a set of CmFile. Each of these
	new CmFile's is created for a filePath found in in externalLink attribute of a TsString.
  27 October 2010 (7000029): Make CmFile.InternalPath a relative path for any files relative to LinkedFilesRootDir
  25 October 2010 (7000028): Make LexEntries be unowned.
  5 October 2010 (7000027): Added a reference on ScrFootnotes to the paragraph that contains the

	1. Rename LangProject_AnalysisStatus to LangProject_Status.
		2. Remove LexDb_Status property.
  14 September 2010  (7000023): Shift case from upper to lower on all guids,
	to make it easier for the Chorus diff/merge code to work.
  25 August 2010 (7000022): Added localizations to 26 CmPossibilityList Name properties.
  26 July 2010 (7000021): This is now a no-op (see 7000027).
  1 July 2010 (7000020): Implements FWR-1175 by removing all UserView, UserViewRec, and
	UserViewField objects that were used by Data Notebook or List Editor.
  5 April 2010 (7000019):
	1. Removed LgWritingSystem and changed all references to LgWritingSystem to string properties.
	2. Removed LgCollation.
	3. Removed CmSortSpec.
  19 May 2010 [7000018]: Implements much of FWR-1163, removing the Styles property from LexDb.
	The LexDb styles are moved to the LangProject Styles property if they don't already exist
	there.
  18 May 2010 [7000017]: Implements FWR-465 by removing the WeatherConditions list from
	LangProject and the Weather field from RnGenericRec.  If the data is in use, the data
	migration moves the list to unowned (ie, a custom list), and creates a custom field in
	RnGenericRec to hold the references.
   5 April 2010 (7000016):
	No model change.  Implements FWR-463 to add a few new record types for Data Notebook, and to
	rearrange the record type list hierarchy.
  20 March 2010 (7000015):
	No model change in this version. This one just works over the xml
	to remove the class-level elements, and move their child elements up one level to be
	children of the main <rt> element.
  8 March 2010 (7000014):
	1. Added new properties Approves and Disapproves, owning atomic CmAgentEvaluations, to CmAgent.
	2. Added new property Evaluations to WfiAnalysis, a reference collection of CmAgentEvaluations.
	3. Removed property Evaluations from CmAgent.

	The information previously represented by a CmAgentEvaluation owned by agentX with tartget WfiAnalysisY
	is now represented by a reference from WfiAnalysisY.Evaluations to either the Approves or Disapproves
	evaluation owned by agentX. Accepted is replaced by the new virtual property Approves on CmAgentEvaluation.
	If it becomes necessary to specify agent evaluations of other object types, they will need their own
	Evaluations properties.
  22 February 2010 (7000013):
	Changed ConstChartWordGroup to ConstChartTag where the previous had BeginSegment == null
  22 January 2010 (7000011):

  8 December 2009 (7000010):
	1.	Add new class called “Note” with these properties
	  a.	Content : multistring
	2.	Add new class called “Segment” with these properties
	  a.	FreeTranslation : multistring

	  c.	Notes : owning sequence of Note
	  d.	Analyses : reference sequence of IAnalysis
	3.	Add new owning sequence property to StTxtPara called Segments with a signature of Segment
	4. Lots of other changes for discourse and text tagging. (cf. https://www.wiki.insitehome.org/display/LSDEV/Getting+rid+of+XFics?ticket=ST-ZUvKBoORGvh5WnuQpvdDsa1qgWbmryS1HKhIJUYlrznu9kPTbhJAelI60lPEg for full details.)
	5. Reordered the classes and properties to be in numerical order to make it easier to find the next number when adding new classes or properties.
  30 November 2009 (7000009):
	Remove own flid and own ord from data. (No actual model change.)
  11 November 2009 (7000008):

  13 October 2009 (7000007):
	  1) Remove ScrImportSet.ImportSettings
	  2) Remove StFootnote.DisplayFootnoteReference and DisplayFootnoteMarker
	  3) Remove StPara.StyleName
  24 September 2009 (7000006-Change model to remove the Name field from CmProject )
  30 September 2009 (NA): Add optional 'generateBasicCreateMethod' attribute to class element
	which controls the code generator's production of the default factory Create method.
  16 September 2009 (7000005): Change model for Data Notebook to combine the RnEvent and RnAnalysis classes into RnGenericRec.)
  14 September 2009 (7000004): [Note: This one will start the use of 'DoNothingDataMigration' step.]

	  2) Add ParseIsCurrent to StTxtPara
	  3) Move ScrTxtPara and ScrFootnote from Cellar module to Scripture module.
	9 September 2009 (7000003): Changed all StFootnotes to ScrFootnotes [cf. DataMigration7000003 class.]
	8 September 2009 (7000002): Changed all StTxtParas owned by Scripture to be ScrTxtParas [cf. DataMigration7000002 class.]
	3 September 2009 (7000001): Remove WordformInventory class from model. [cf. DataMigration7000001 class.]
	2 September 2009 (NA): Add schema and optional 'singleton' and 'owner' attributes to <class> element. [Nothing at all for data migration.]

			<para>John W. (Mar 20, 2002) adds that in the "Default Style Sheet" specification, we talk about "factory" styles:</para>
			<para>"This document describes the style sheet that will ship with the FieldWorks Translation Editor. Generally speaking, users can add, modify or delete styles; this document is concerned with the style sheet as it is installed from the factory, and thus the "factory styles" which cannot be renamed or deleted..</para>
			<para>There are two sets of styles, one for published materials (Scripture text, introductions, etc.) and one for non-published materials (back translation, consultant notes, etc.) For the former we started with the main styles found in the Paratext stylesheet for the TEV, and modified it as is appropriate for the FieldWorks environment. </para>

			<para>1. The user will not be permitted to rename or delete these. </para>
			<para>2. The user is permitted to change their attributes, including paragraph, font, etc.</para>
			<para>3. The user is permitted to edit their "Usage" attribute. "</para>
			<para>Ken Z. added on Mar 20, 2002:</para>
			<para>We need some way of saying that certain styles are used by code, and thus can't be deleted or renamed. I believe this might be done right now by hard coding these style names in the styles dialog to keep them from being changed. It seems like IsBuiltIn should be able to serve this function so that we can designate certain styles as built-in and therefore guaranteed to always be there. Unless Bryan or someone else sees a reason not to do this, I think we should add this to the specification. As such, it will be used by more than just the Translation Editor.</para>
			<para>Ken Z. also notes the following:</para>
			<para>As for Lela-Teli sample styles, they should not have the IsBuiltIn property set even though they are delivered "from the factory". From all responses, I think it is safe to say that any style that has the IsBuiltIn flag set should not be deleted or renamed by any program.</para>

			<para>Headings are extra-canonical material used to help the reader know what a particular passage is about. Example: "The Genealogy of Jesus" for the passage (ScrSection) of Matthew 1:1-17. Although these are normally just a short-line, they sometimes are multi-lined including Headings and Subheadings.

If there is no vDefaultInflectionClass, then there are presumably no inflection classes (since the default value for vDefaultInflectionClass is the first inflection class of the paradigm). The assumption here is that inflection class membership is essentially an arbitrary label, i.e. that the inflection class membership of a stem cannot and should not be defined by a set of stem allomorphs or lists of 'principal parts' (see discussion in Carstairs-McCarthy 1998b: 332-334).</para>

		  <comment>
			<para>Refers to a collection of CmPossibility, giving any exceptional properties of the stem that relate to restricting the productivity of affixes. (Other terms for this are 'exception features,' 'rule features' and 'ad hoc features'.) Usually these represent restrictions which are shared among a set of more than two morphemes (unlike AMPLE's 'ad hoc pairs', which concern a pair of morphemes). An example from English is the feature [+Latinate], marking that part of the English vocabulary which is etymologically derived from Latin, and which has certain synchronic properties. For example, the suffix -ity attaches only to [+Latinate] stems (Aronoff 1976: 51): felicity, vivacity, *widity, *strongity The similar suffix -ness, on the other hand, attaches to more or less all adjectives regardless of this feature. Similar restrictions are apparently found in other languages which have undergone substantial borrowing, e.g. Mohawk and Dutch are said to have restrictions which depend on whether or not stems were borrowed from French. Maybe there are other sources of such restrictions as well. These restrictions cannot be handled by inflection classes. The reason is that inflection classes and exception features are likely to be cross-cutting distinctions. Another sort of restriction for which exception features have sometimes been used, is for certain restricted (morpho-)phonological alternations, such as the Velar Softening rule of English (Chomsky and Halle 1968; Aronoff 1976: 51). However, this use is sometimes complicated by restrictions on adjacency, which cannot be easily modeled. An apparent alternative to exception features would be morphosyntactic features. However, exception features are (by definition) invisible to the syntax, and the use of morphosyntactic features for this purpose could incorrectly prevent unification of features in syntax, e.g. if we build an NP consisting of a [+Latinate] noun and an [-Latinate] determiner. See also MoDerivationalAffixMsa.FromProductivityRestrictions. Do exception features percolate? There is some inconclusive discussion of this in Aronoff 1976: 52. Note that the answer to this will not directly affect the domain model, only the parser and generator (unless we decide to leave it up to the user, and put a toggle somewhere). See also note under MoDerivationalAffixMsa.</para>

			<para>If a user has specified Morphology, then FW should by default set a link to the entry that has a morph type of root. In the case of two or more roots, FW makes an arbitrary decision. Like other parts of the WW system, default choices should be indicated to the user so they can review them. In the majority of cases for subentry-like entries this will be only one entry (establishment points to establish) but with the possibility of more for entries that have more than one root in them (blackboard may point to board and black). For inflected forms, there will ALWAYS be only one entry pointed to (men points to man). (This used to be on LexSubentry and MainEntryOrSense on LexMinorEntry.) Subentries can be "subs" of either a major entry, another subentry, a minor entry (very rare) or a particular sense of any of the above.

			<para>This Variant Entry Types list is used to classify a LexEntryRef via VariantEntryTypes. ItemClsid should be set to LexEntryType, IsSorted to true, and Depth to 127. The list is hierarchical with the top level being the type of variant (e.g., dialectal) and subitems being the conditions (e.g., British English, American English) for that type of variant. Normally the user will set this property to a subitem, although a top level item could be used if the user does not want to specify the condition. The user is free to provide additional nesting if useful. All items in the list will be LexEntryType, so the user will need to specify an appropriate Abbreviation and ReverseAbbr for each item in the list. This gives greater control to the user than having the program try to piece together information from a hierarchy of LexEntryTypes. The Abbreviation is used when displaying the main entry from the minor entry (e.g., Brit. dial. of color). The ReverseAbbr is used when displaying the minor entry from the main entry (e.g., Brit. dial. colour). Entries using this list will be displayed as minor entries in the dictionary; usually following the main entry headword and will typically produce a separate minor entry in the dictionary referring to the main entry. The initial list may have:</para>

		<para>This abstract class is intended to capture co-occurrence restrictions between morphemes or allomorphs which cannot be captured using morphosyntactic or phonological restrictions. Linguistically speaking, this is perhaps as bad a kludge as you can imagine. We allow it here for reasons of stealth-to-wealth work, with the understanding that the program will twist the user's arm into getting rid of these later on (perhaps by flagging each of these constraints with a Warning). The technique is borrowed from AMPLE's ad hoc pairs. Note however that, Aronoff (1976: 53) gives as an example of a negative constraint the fact that the suffix -ness does not attach to adjectives of the form X-ate, X-ant, or X-ent. So maybe this isn't such a kludge after all. On the other hand, Aronoff's examples are largely statistical generalizations, that is, tendencies - as opposed to hard constraints.</para>
		<para>It may be that we should also have positive cooccurrence constraints. Aronoff (1976: 63) lists a number of "forms of the base" which are compatible with the English prefix un-, among them X-en (where -en is the past participle suffix), X-ing, and X-able, which would be examples of positive constraints. However, un- also attaches to a good many monomorphemic stems (roots, e.g. unhappy), so it may be that this is not a real generalization.</para>
		<para>In addition to the attributes below, there should probably be an attribute to point to analyses which are ruled out by these constraints. These could be either grammatical words for which the parser would generate an incorrect analysis if it were not for this constraint, or ungrammatical words which the user has supplied, and which would be parsed if not for this constraint. It may even be desirable to allow individual constraints to be turned off in the parsing of such examples, in order to verify that the constraint works, and that it is (still) needed. However, the need for such an attr is probably more general than this class; see my email of 18 Jan 2000.</para>
		<para>Attributes: (Note also that both subclasses define an attribute to hold a seq of objects that are prohibited from co-occurring.

		<para>For Item-and-Arrangement allomorphs. Regardless of theoretical propensities, this is the sort of analysis that linguists usually start out with (with the probable exception of reduplicative affixation, at least once the linguist has figured out that the affix is reduplicative).</para>
		<para>In the current model, each allomorph is owned by a single affix (LexEntry). It has sometimes been argued that the phonological form is shared among distinct morphemes (Robins 1959). For example, in English the third person present tense verbal suffix, the noun plural suffix, and the possessive clitic all arguably have the same form. The LinguaLinks conceptual model supports this viewpoint, but it appears to have caused a great deal of confusion among users (Larry Hayashi, email 13 April 1999), and even programming bugs. The model described here does not support the independence of allomorphs from morphemes; rather, each morpheme owns its own allomorphs.</para>

			<para>refers to a collection of PhEnvironment objects, describing what the phonetic environment of this allomorph is.</para>
			<para>The use of the term 'phonetic' is not intended to distinguish this from a phonological context, merely to say that the context is described in terms of its phonetic properties, not its morphosyntactic properties or lexically marked exception properties.</para>
			<para>If this attribute is uninstantiated, there is no phonetic restriction on the environment.</para>
			<para>The reason this is a collection attr (rather than atomic) is to allow for the situation during analysis before the user has managed to collapse what appear to be disparate environments into a single environment. (Note that the 'elsewhere' case can be represented by an empty environment under the assumption of disjunctive ordering.) Hence, a step in the stealth-to-wealth process will be to reduce the cardinality of this collection to one. A collection may of course also be useful for allomorphs which actually does appear in a disparate set of environments.</para>
			<para>For the reason why this is a ref attribute, rather than an owning attribute, see the discussion of MoMorphologicalData.PhoneEnvs.</para>
			<para>An important assumption here is that the phonetic environment to which this allomorph refers is the derived phonological environment. In the absence of phonological rules, this means that the phonetic environment refers to the allomorph(s) to its left, not to some base form of the morphemes. (If we later implement phonological rules, this implies we implement cyclic phonological processes.) The effect of iterative application of phonological rules would not be possible under this approach, although most cases might fall out from the step-wise attachment of affixes, which more or less amounts to cyclic rule application (without rules).</para>
			<para>Alternatively, we could allow reference to either (or both) the underlying and derived environments (which would in turn imply that every morpheme would need to have an underlying form); this would be similar to two-level phonology.</para>

			<para>refers to a PartOfSpeech, defining the morphosyntactic features which the stem to which this affix attaches must bear.</para>
			<para>Together with the MsEnvFeatures attribute (below), this attribute defines the morphosyntactic context in which this allomorph must appear. However, there are linguistic reasons for thinking that allomorphs should not in fact be able to specify morphosyntactic requirements on their environment. That is, there are often (always?) better analyses of allomorphy which do not rely on the morphosyntactic properties of the stem (see e.g. Matthews' 1972b reanalysis of Huave). The attribute is there because AMPLE provides that power (although AMPLE allows the user to test the morphosyntactic properties of arbitrary morphemes to the left or right, while the intention here is that an allomorph can only test the morphosyntactic properties of the stem to which it attaches).</para>
			<para>Since the parts of speech are contained in an inheritance hierarchy, a question arises: if this attr points to an abstract part of speech (verb, say), does a stem with a more specific part of speech (transitive verb, say) match? In the absence of any reason to think it does not, I would suggest that reference to an abstract part of speech entails that more specific parts of speech are included. Otherwise, it is hard to imagine how one could use this attribute-it would be necessary to allow a seq, or else to have separate but homophonous allomorphs for each specific part of speech.</para>
			<para>It is not clear what should be done if there are conflicts between the morphosyntactic requirements imposed by this attribute, and those imposed by the affix owning this allomorph. Such conflicts "should" not arise (since allomorphs shouldn't have special morphosyntactic requirements of their own, as argued in the previous paragraph). While it would be fairly simple to ensure that conflicts do not arise between stated morphosyntactic properties, there is the potential for implicit conflicts (e.g. the affix calls for attachment to a noun, while the allomorph requires that the stem have a certain feature value for subject agreement-something which nouns presumably do not mark).</para>

		  <comment>
			<para>refers to an ordered seq of PhEnvironment, encoding the position relative to the stem in which this allomorph goes (for example, before the stem, after the stem, orbetween the first two consonants of the stem).</para>
			<para>A default value for this attr should be provided for prefixes and suffixes, based on MoForm.MorphType. For a prefix, this would be __#X (where X represents the entire stem), and for a suffix, X#__. This attr need not be displayed for prefixes andsuffixes.</para>
			<para>Note that it would not be possible to simplify the model by eliminating this attr, and letting the position of infixation be determined by the phonological environment of the allomorph(s). The reason this can't be done is that what is important for purposes of allomorphy vs. what is important for positioning the infix, are two different things. The reason for having this attr as a property of the allomorph, rather than of the MSA, is that this allows us to distinguish two different allomorphs which differ as to whether they are infixed or not. For example, there is a Tagalog affix whose infixed form is -in-, and whose prefixed form is ?in- (although the word-initial glottal happens not to be written orthographically).</para>
			<para>An alternative to having this attr on MoAffixAllomorph would be to add a subclass of this class for infixes (as well as suprafixes and other sorts of affixes that must appear in a particular position, other than before or after the stem). This new subclass would then have the extra attribute for position. One disadvantage of having such a subclass, is that it would be the only subclass of MoAffixAllomorph, whereas in fact all specific types of affixes (prefixes, suffixes, infixes,...) are sub-types. Having a default value of this attr for prefixes and suffixes adequately characterizes the difference between prefixes and suffixes on the one hand, and infixes on the other.</para>
			<para>The attr is a seq (as opposed to atomic) to account for affixes whose position relative to the stem is determined by the phonology of the stem. For example, in Tagalog the in affix occurs after the first consonant of a C-initial stem, or (prefixed) before a vowel-initial stem. (Note that this implies that an affix may not be purely a prefix or infix, contrary to the implication of the MorphType attr. The alternative is to require the user to treat such an affix as having two allomorphs, one a prefix and one an infix; but this would seem to be an unnecessary burden for the user.)</para>
			<para>The attr is an ordered seq (as opposed to a collection) in order to allow disjunctive ordering. Taking the example given above, disjunctive ordering would require the following environments, stored in an ordered seq:</para>
			<para>    #C__, #__</para>
			<para>Nondisjunctive ordering would require the following environments (which could be stored in a collection):</para>
			<para>    #C__, #__V</para>
			<para>Using an ordered seq does not force the parser/ generator to use the ordering, but allows for parsers which do use the order (such as Hermit Crab).</para>

That is, an inflectional affix should either specify a single inflection class, or it should be the elsewhere case, in which case it does not specify any inflection class (Carstairs-McCarthy 1994). It is nonetheless defined here as a seq attr, (1) for stealth-to-wealth reasons, and (2) because this theoretical claim may be wrong. There should however be tools to help the analyst discover inflectional affixes which have more than one inflection class specified in this attr, and if possible correct the analysis.</para>

		<para>For Item-and-Process allomorphs (in the sense of 'Item and Process' morphology in which affixes are processes, not the sense in which allomorphy is caused by the action of phonological processes).</para>
		<para>Using the Output attr (defined below), it is possible to reduce the number of allomorphs of a given morpheme under the process approach. For example, an affix with an initial consonant whose voicing agrees with the voicing of the final phoneme of the stem can be described as a single allomorph by using the appropriate phonological properties. At the same time, since any one affix can have multiple MoAffixForm objects, including multiple MoAffixProcesses, it is not necessary that all allomorphy be accounted for within the Output attr. Indeed, with phonologically conditioned suppletion (Carstairs 1990), it will be necessary to resort to multiple allomorphs even under the process view.</para>
		<para>There is no provision in the model as it currently exists for '(re)adjustment rules', defined as "rules which change the segmental shape of designated morphemes in the immediate environment of other designated morphemes" (i.e. rules of truncation and allomorphy; Chomsky and Halle 1968: 238-239; Aronoff 1976, chapter five; Scalise 1986: 63-67). The assumption here is that morphological rules themselves will define any such allomorphy (and that eventually, phonological rules will be added to the model to deal with allomorphy that is not specific to a certain morpheme). Several objections could be raised against this:</para>
		<para>(1) It has been argued (Aronoff 1976, chapter five) that morphological rules are not the appropriate place to define allomorphy.</para>
		<para>(2) Treating allomorphy with morphological rules works well only when the allomorphy is inwardly sensitive, that is, when the allomorphy is in an affix, conditioned by the form of the stem to which it attaches. There is no obvious way in Item-and-Process morphology to treat outwardly-sensitive allomorphy which depends on the specific morpheme affected, as opposed to just the (underlying) phonetic form of that morpheme. In particular, it is difficult to treat allomorphy affecting a class of roots. For further discussion, see Maxwell 1996, appendix 3.</para>
		<para>Additional Notes: In regard to point (1) above, Mike Maxwell states: For the record, I do not find Aronoff’s arguments strong. In particular, there are better solutions using morphological rules than the rule of Truncation that he considers on page 89, which is effectively a straw man.</para>
		<para>In regard to point (2) above, one work-around would be to use paradigm classes.</para>

		<para>This is an abstract class, encompassing endocentric, exocentric, and coordinate compounds, as well as incorporation (e.g. incorporation of a direct object into a verb).</para>
		<para>There is a typology of compound types given in Spencer (1991: 310ff.); some of the compounds he discusses shade into idioms.</para>
		<para>This model does not attempt to account for the semantics of compounds in the compounding rule, since this is largely unpredictable. Nor do we attempt to account for argument linking. For example, Lieber (1983: 258) claims that an element of a compound must be able to link to all its obligatory internal arguments. That is, if an argument-taking element is a non-head, it must find its argument within the compound (Lieber's example is drawbridge, where bridge is the internal argument of draw); otherwise (if the argument-taking element is the head of the compound ), it can link to arguments which are external to the compound (Lieber's example is hand-weave). Accounting for argument linking would require at a minimum that we model argument requirements of lexemes (i.e. subcategorization lists). However, argument linking is also closely related to semantic and pragmatic issues, which are well outside the scope of our plans.</para>
		<para>Additional notes from Andy Black January 2002:</para>
		<para>The old way used ref attrs (at least to POS) because they directly referred to POS. The new way is for the compound rule to own an MSA (which in turn can refer to a POS and can own FS, etc.)</para>
		<para>So I'm rather sure that these MSA attrs of compound rules are supposed to be owning. If they were referring, I have no idea what MSA they would refer to. The Msas in a compound rule do not belong to a particular lexical item, they just happen to have all the relevant information needed by a compound rule.</para>
		<para>Response from Randy Regnier:</para>
		<para>Well, maybe then I am missing something. What will a compound rule actually control then? I gather it won’t actually use the MSA directly. I had assumed something along the lines of X and Y can be compounds. But if X and Y are independently owned Msas, then the parser will never find them in the lexicon.</para>
		<para>Randy</para>
		<para>Response from Andy:</para>
		<para>For all three stages, the manifestation of a compound rule is a rule in our word grammar rule.</para>
		<para>This rule will be of the form</para>
		<para>rule {Stem via compound rule crVAdv}</para>
		<para>  Stem_1 = Stem_2 Stem_3</para>
		<para>with appropriate constraints. The constraints will have to check the POS and FS of each MSA within the rule. They might end up looking like this:</para>
		<para>                          | constraints</para>
		<para>     &lt;Stem_2 synCat&gt; = { posV / posVIntrans / posVTrans}</para>
		<para>     &lt;Stem_3 synCat&gt; = posIncAdv</para>
		<para>where the values on the right hand side will come from these owned Msas (i.e. we will get the POS value from the POSs within the toMsa and fromMsa). We'll do something similar for the FS of these Msas.</para>
		<para>In the above constraints, it says that the left member has to be a verb (or one of its subtypes) and the right member has to be an "incorporated adverb." (This is from the ZPU data, where I think that the adverbial suffixes are really just incorporated adverbs, hence compounded.)</para>
		<para>The Stem_2 and Stem_3 get their "synCat" values from another rule:</para>
		<para>rule {Stem consisting of a single root}</para>
		<para>  Stem = root</para>
		<para>           | percolation</para>
		<para>        &lt;Stem synCat&gt;          = &lt;root rootCat&gt;</para>
		<para>        (etc.)</para>
		<para>So the lexical items will be put into the word tree as "roots" and their lexical MSA info will be passed up to the Stem node. This Stem node may then become part of a compound rule (either as Stem_2 or as Stem_3).</para>

		<para>This class is intended for derivational affixes. Since the current model does not allow for non-realizational versions of inflectional morphology, this class could probably be used to treat inflectional morphology under a Lieber-style analysis.</para>
		<para>According to the "Unitary Base Hypothesis", "the syntacticosemantic specification of the base of a word formation rule may be more or less complex, but it is always unique" (Scalise 1986: 136; see also Aronoff 1976: 47ff.). In our terms, there is a one-to-one relationship between a sense of a derivational affix and its morphosyntactic specification. While that could be captured in the conceptual model (of LexEntry for affixes), it is not. From a stealth-to-wealth standpoint, that may be just as well, although we could encourage it by procedural code (and doing so might push the linguist to deeper investigation of the semantics of affixes which are apparent counterexamples to the Unitary Base Hypothesis).</para>
		<para>There are some affixes (probably mostly derivational affixes) which attach only to stems of a specific phonological shape. For example, the English inchoative suffix -en attaches productively only to adjectives ending in t and d (brighten, *dimmen; exceptions such as blacken and darken are said to date from an earlier period in English, see Aronoff 1976: 79). The model does not provide for this sort of restriction on morphemes. One work-around is to encode the restriction at the level of the allomorph (MoAffixForm), and have only that one allomorph for the affix.</para>
		<para>Should derivational affixes be allowed to add exception features to a word (e.g. by percolation)? There are some arguments back and forth in Aronoff 1976: 52, although it certainly looks like derivational affixes should be able to have exception features (the question is whether they percolate). See also discussion under the MoStemMsa.ExceptionFeatures.</para>

			<para>specifies the category of the stem to which this affix attaches. See comments above on the "Unitary Base Hypothesis." Note also that in AMPLE, it is possible to map a series of categories into another series of categories; that capability is not defined here. If the parts of speech list is hierarchical, the problem could be partially circumvented by specifying an abstract category in this attribute. However, that would not solve the problem of mapping the output category, because at best we could specify more than a single output category.</para>
			<para>Note that we do not (yet) have provision for subcategorization lists or argument structure. This means that some restrictions on the stem to which an affix would be attached cannot be handled elegantly. (They could be handled inelegantly, by creating an ad hoc feature for each subcategorization, e.g. [+ditransitive].) For example, the English suffix -able attaches only to transitive verbs (washable, *seemable); the English suffix -ee attaches only to verbs which allow animate objects or indirect objects (addressee, *tearee) (examples from Scalise 1986: 45). Nor do we treat semantic restrictions on the base to which the affix attaches. For example, it has been proposed that the English prefix re- attaches only to verbs whose meaning entails a change of state (John repunched the holes in the paper, *John repunched Bill in the face) (Aronoff 1976: 47, observation attributed to an unpublished paper of Williams).</para>

			<para>Note that as with the FromPartOfSpeech, we do not (yet) cover subcategorization lists or argument structure here. Thus, we cannot handle subcategorization-changing affixes, such as causatives, by changing a subcategorization list, only by changing category or morphosyntactic features. Likewise, we cannot handle the change in argument structure that accompanies some category-changing affixes. For example, when the prefix en- verbalizes an adjective, the argument of which the adjective was predicated becomes the direct object of the verb (The picture is large - to enlarge the picture; example from Scalise 1986: 28).</para>

			<para>specifies the inflection (conjugation or declension) class which the stem to which this affix attaches must belong. In general, derivational affixes are arguably not marked for this property, so this attribute may be superfluous. However, it will certainly be necessary if non-Inflectional inflectional morphology is to be modeled using this class. (And it may turn out that some derivational affixes are sensitive to the inflectional class of their stem.)</para>
			<para>Under the realizational model of inflectional morphology, the inflection class to which an allomorph of an inflectional (realizational) affix belongs is indicated by MoAffixForm.InflectionClasses. That attribute is also available for allomorphs of derivational affixes (i.e. this class). That might be overkill, in that if a derivational affix attaches to stems of a single inflectional class, we could assign a single allomorph to that affix, and capture the restriction of the affix to the inflectional class as a restriction on that allomorph. However, the fromInflectionClass attribute here is parallel to the toInflectionClass attribute (defined below), which is independently needed. (Andy suggests that it may also be the case that a derivational affix would apply to a single inflection class, but have multiple allomorphs, in which case it would be convenient to have the attribute here, thereby avoiding the need to mark each allomorph for the same inflection class.)</para>

			<para>InflectionClass: refers to an MoInflectionClass. This gives the inflection class to which the word being derived belongs, at this stage in the derivation. The algorithm for computing this is rather complex (which is why I have not defined this as a virtual attr), but basically it is this: If the last MoDerivationalAffix attached specifies a ToInflectionClass, then this attr is that inflection class. If the last MoDerivationalAffix attached does not specify a ToInflectionClass, then we collect all the derivational affixes attached inside that one which have the same ToPartOfSpeech or a PartOfSpeech which is a subcategory or a supercategory of the last derivational affix's part of speech, stopping when we come to a part of speech which is not the same or a subcategory or a supercategory. The outermost of these affixes which specifies a ToInflectionClass is used for this stage's InflectionClass. If none of these affixes specifies a ToInflectionClass, and the MoStemMsa is accessible (meaning none of the affixes has a contrary ToPartOfSpeech), then we use the InflectionClass of that stem. If all of these possibilities fail, we use the vDefaultInflectionClass of the PartOfSpeech.</para>

		<para>This subclass of MoBinaryCompoundRule serves for endocentric compounds and incorporation structures, in which the morphosyntactic properties of the head constituent determine the morphosyntactic properties of the compound structure. Typically only the head is inflected, as well. Most English compounds are of this type.</para>
		<para>Note that the head constituent is best defined in terms of the relationship between the head and the whole, rather than the relationship between the two constituents; thus, the English killjoy is not endocentric, despite the fact that kill presumably selects joy. See Fabb (1998: 70).</para>
		<para>This class does not provide a way to override the percolation of the head's morphosyntactic properties to the output structure, this being essentially the definition of 'head'. However, this may be too strict a limitation, in that a construction might override the head properties by imposing a minor modification on the morphosyntactic properties of the output. For example, in languages with (true) incorporation, incorporation of the direct object may or may not make the resulting verb intransitive (Baker 1996: 31). We use the OverridingMsa attribute to override percolation of features, or (better) to change the subcategorization list of the head.</para>
		<para>Note:There are theory-internal considerations here. For example, Baker treats overt NPs in polysynthetic languages as adjuncts, not complements. In a certain sense, then, a verb - with or without an incorporated object noun - is not transitive.</para>
		<para>Endocentric compounds are inflected on their heads (Scalise 1986: 124), and the parsing/ generation algorithm will need to take this into consideration. Non-heads of endocentric compounds are usually uninflected, even when the word in question is always inflected in isolation. An English example is pluralia tantum words like scissors and trousers, which appear in their singular forms in compounds: scissor-handle and trouser-leg (example (68) in Scalise 1986: 123). This will be reflected in the LeftFeatures or RightFeatures of the appropriate member. Exceptions sometimes occur with irregular plurals: teethmarks (but cf. toothbrush, *teethbrush).</para>

		<para>This is an abstract class, with subclasses for roots and affixes.</para>
		<para>MoForms are stored in the Forms attr of LexEntries. That attr needs to be a sequence (not collection) attr, because the ordering of the allomorphs is relevant if their environments of occurrence are taken to be disjunctively ordered (a common assumption). For example, the English noun plural suffix (as well as the third person singular present tense verb suffix and the possessive enclitic) has the form /«z/ after strident sounds, /s/ after (non-strident) voiceless sounds, and /z/ elsewhere. The latter environment can most easily be represented as "otherwise," a characterization which requires disjunctive ordering. The environment for /s/ is also most simply represented if disjunctive ordering is assumed: /s/ appears after voiceless sounds, unless the /«z/ is more appropriate. Without disjunctive ordering, it would be necessary to explicitly disallow /s/ after strident sounds, recapitulating the information that /«z/ appears in that environment.</para>
		<para>When we add a morphophonology component, there will need to be a way of telling whether a given allomorph is predictable by phonological rule. In the case of a stem, this would require creating an underlying form, then trying to derive the entire paradigm of the stem from that underlying form. In order to thoroughly test the rule(s), it would also be necessary to test the paradigms of any other stems arising from the attachment of a derivational affix to that stem, and any compounds formed with the stem. The endpoint of the task of deriving allomorphs from underlying forms, is to reduce the number of allomorphs of each morpheme to one (apart from suppletion).</para>
		<para>A phonological rule can potentially modify any stem in the lexicon, so the introduction of a phonological rule implies full-fledged testing. Note however that the use of strata might ameliorate these effects. For example, if allomorphs are assigned to a higher stratum than underlying forms, and the phonological rule applies prior to that higher stratum, it cannot affect those allomorphs. This assumes the presence of the allomorphs is not required for purposes of the rule’s environment.</para>

			<para>It is not clear to me what is supposed to go into this attribute for process affixes (MoAffixProcess), since these do not have a form per se (and in some cases, such as reduplication, there is no form at all). One could use this for a description of the process affix, but that usage would then not parallel the usage in other subclasses.</para>
			<para>Null inflectional affixes are usually unnecessary in a realizational theory of morphology; putative null derivational affixes can usually be modeled by multiple parts of speech for (lexically listed) stems; and null stems are quite rare. Nonetheless, for purposes of stealth to wealth, as well as for the rare situation where null affixes or stems are actually required, this Form attr can hold an empty string. (See e.g. the discussion of spanned slots in the MoInflAffixTemplate class for one situation where null affixes may be necessary.) There is no assurance that all the strings in this multilingual attr will be null or non-null, but even this looseness may occasionally be useful—where an affix is overt in one encoding, but covert in another. An example would be an affix consisting of a tone: tones might be marked in some encodings, but unmarked in others.</para>

Other kinds of affixation (circumfixes, simulfixes, suprafixes etc.) are probably beyond the capabilities of Item-and-Arrangement morphology, and may therefore need to be prevented from appearing (or grayed out) with the class MoAffixAllomorph.</para>
			<para>Additional Notes: It is of course possible to analyze reduplication as the attachment of a prosodic constituent, such as a syllable (see McCarthy and Prince 1990), provided there is some way of filling the melodic information into that skeleton. But the system described here does not provide a way of automatically copying such melodic information, so reduplication cannot be treated in that way at present.

This is intentional: a slot need not have any coherent semantics (Matthews 1972b: 116). LH: Really? That seems "ungrammatical" to me. The semantics may not be limited to a particular function but those semantics are nonetheless there and captured by the features on the affix are they not? Perhaps that's what you just said. MM: The individual affixes have their semantics (as given by their morphosyntactic feature values), and typically all the affixes in a given slot instantiate values for the same set of morphosyntactic features. It's where this doesn't happen that there is no semantics for the slot [It is] an exemplary tagmemic analysis, and it is surely for precisely that reason that the system of the language has become obscured."

			<para>Optional: Boolean, default False. A value of true indicates that this slot is optional and therefore does not have to appear. This is not intended for slots which have what might be called a zero morpheme-see the discussion of the 'Affixes' attribute immediately above. Rather, this attribute is intended for the situation in which a language optionally marks some feature-value combinations. For example, in Tzeltal the plurality of a noun is only optionally marked: a suffix indicates that the noun is plural, but the absence of a plural suffix does not mean the noun is necessarily singular. For this situation, an optional slot containing the plural morpheme would be appropriate.</para>
			<para>Implementation Note: In the Tzeltal case discussed above, it would probably be inappropriate for the parser to say that a noun without an overt plural suffix was ambiguous between a singular reading and a plural one. Rather, it should unambiguously parse as unmarked for plurality.</para>

		<para>An Inflectional Affix Template allows for the implementation of 'template morphology' (Anderson 1992, Stump 1998; note that an affix template essentially corresponds to Stump's 'Paradigm Function Schema'). An Affix Template provides for a sequence of slots (Stump's term; 'rule blocks', in Anderson's terminology) in which Inflectional affixes may appear-in effect, order classes for affixes. However, there is a difference from traditional position (order) classes, in that the latter were intended to capture two things: cooccurrence restrictions, and linear order, whereas affix templates are intended to capture (most cases of) cooccurrence restrictions, and are to some extent agnostic about linear order. While the order of affixes in affix templates usually corresponds to the linear order, it is possible to have both prefixes and suffixes in the same template (or even in the same slot). The need for this (or more commonly, perhaps, for infixes and prefixes in the same template or slot) is not unheard of; Stump (1993a: 457) gives an example from Sanskrit in which one affix in a slot is a suffix, while the other is a simulfix. Even then, it is sometimes possible to treat the infix or simulfix (etc.) as if it were a slightly odd prefix or suffix. Examples of so-called 'discontinuous bleeding' between prefixes and suffixes also exist, but are rarer (see for example Matthews (1972b), particularly his "series 30" on page 113). In true cases of discontinuous bleeding, the slots of the template will no longer represent position classes. (Anderson 1992: 131, on the other hand, says that the question of whether slots/ blocks correspond to the traditional notion of position classes is open.)</para>
		<para>Having said this, it will usually be reasonable to begin under the stealth-to-wealth approach with a traditional position class approach, assuming that affixes that occur in the same position relative to the stem and to each other belong to the same slots. (Discovering these position classes could be assisted by a program like PARADIGM (Grimes 1983).) Only when discontinuous bleeding cannot be accounted for in other ways (e.g. by assuming that one or the other of the affixes in question requires a more specific set of Inflectional features) will it be necessary to combine prefixes and suffixes, say, into a single slot. It should also be noted that there is no attribute in the template (or on the slots) distinguishing those slots which are prefixes from those which are suffixes, although it would be easy to create a virtual attribute which would show this where appropriate (i.e. where all the affixes of a given slot are suffixes, or all are prefixes).</para>
		<para>MoInflAffixTemplates are owned by PartOfSpeech objects.</para>
		<para>It might be nice if distinct MoInflAffixTemplates could inherit properties from each other. For instance, the Affix Template for a transitive verb might be just like that of an intransitive verb, save for having an additional slot for affixes marking object agreement. Unfortunately, MoInflAffixTemplates probably cannot participate in inheritance, since their principal attribute is the ordered list of MoInflAffixSlots, and it is unclear how inheritance of elements in a list could be done. (For example, it is unclear how an object slot could be inserted among the slots of another template.) However, since the MoInflAffixSlots themselves are owned by the PartOfSpeech, it is quite possible for two MoInflAffixTemplates to share many of the sameMoInflAffixSlots. What they cannot inherit is the order of those shared slots; they can only copy one another's order (and naturally, the copy can be altered, destroying the identical orders-of course, sometimes that is the correct thing!).</para>
		<para>There is no provision as yet for "spanned orders", i.e. overlapping slots; Grimes (1983) gives the following hypothetical example (his figure 1, page 5):</para>
		<para>Order      6       5       4       3       2       1       0</para>
		<para>Prefixes   ma-na-  ba-     da-     ga-     ka-     pa-ta-  Stem</para>
		<para>           sa-za-</para>
		<para>The model may need to be modified to accommodate spanned orders. A work-around would be to assign the affixes of the spanning slot to one of the spanned slots, and to create null affixes with the appropriate morphosyntactic features as fillers for the remaining spanned slots. In many cases, the morphosyntactic features of the non-null spanning affixes can be used for these null affixes as well.</para>

		<para>Inflection Classes correspond to the traditional idea of declension classes (for nouns and adjectives) and conjugation classes (for verbs). The concept is sometimes collapsed with the notion of paradigms (e.g. the "er paradigm"), which may cause confusion.</para>
		<para>Inflection Classes are abstract in the sense that they give instructions for how to build the paradigm of a given lexeme; in that sense, they are like class definitions as contrasted with instances of a class.</para>
		<para>Inflection Classes are owned by a PartOfSpeechgrammar.rtf - PartOfSpeech or by another MoInflectionClass. They thus form a default inheritance hierarchy from most general to most specific, so that Inflection Classes that are specializations of other Inflection Classes can be defined. Importantly, such specializations can define cells of the paradigm which are filled in different ways-exceptions to the inheritance hierarchy.</para>
		<para>There are limits to how far a given Inflection Class can deviate from the Inflection Class that it inherits from. First, there is no provision for inheritance across branches of the tree, i.e. this is a "tree-structured" inheritance hierarchy. Inheritance across branches would allow e.g. the Spanish verb tener to be described as a specialization of both the class of verbs showing the e/ye alternation and of the class showing the n/ng alternation. The problem is that with this across-branches inheritance, it would be possible for a given lexeme to have conflicting properties (ways to fill a single cell) inherited from two or more classes, neither of which is a specialization of the other, and it would be unclear which property "wins." In phonology, an analogous problem would seem to arise with "phonological rule features," each of which can trigger a different set of phonological rules. But the problem is resolved (in derivational theories) because the extrinsic ordering of those rules resolves any conflict, essentially resulting in prioritized multiple inheritance. (Similarly for the inheritance of conflicting phonological constraints under theories with ranked violable constraints, such as Optimality Theory.)</para>
		<para>A second limitation on inheritance is that inflection classes cannot specify alternative dimensions to their paradigms (PartOfSpeech.InflectableFeatures), because the dimensions are defined by the PartOfSpeech that ultimately owns the inflection classes. This limitation is probably realistic.</para>
		<para>A third limitation is that while an Inflection Class can specify an entirely different MoInflAffixTemplate from that of its parent Inflection Class, it cannot specify that one slot within the Affix Template it inherits is different, or that one affix within a given MoInflAffixSlot of that inherited Affix Template is different. This is a serious limitation, as it might be desirable to describe sub-inflection classes in precisely this way. However, it is not clear how this could be implemented , particularly if the inherited-from Template or Slot changes. For example, if a daughter Inflection Class replaced one of the slots of the parent Inflection Class with another, what would happen if the user decided to split the parent class's slot into two slots, or combine it with another slot?</para>

			<para>This reflects what is also referred to as exception features in the literature. It defines class identifiers that can be associated with non-productive derivational or inflectional affixes that only go on stems that belong to the same class. An example from English is the feature [+Latinate], marking that part of the English vocabulary which is etymologically derived from Latin, and which has certain synchronic properties. For example, the suffix -ity attaches only to [+Latinate] stems (Aronoff 1976: 51): felicity, vivacity, *widity, *strongity. The similar suffix -ness, on the other hand, attaches to more or less all adjectives regardless of this feature. Similar restrictions are apparently found in other languages which have undergone substantial borrowing, e.g. Mohawk and Dutch are said to have restrictions which depend on whether or not stems were borrowed from French. Maybe there are other sources of such restrictions as well. These restrictions cannot be handled by inflection classes. The reason is that inflection classes and exception features are likely to be cross-cutting distinctions.</para>

Thus, if in some language, all words of a given category bear (overt) inflectional affixes, talking about the stems of that language does not violate the Word Based Hypothesis.

		<para>From a broad perspective, theories of morphology can be divided into morpheme-based theories and word-based (or better, lexeme-based) theories. The existence of subclasses of this class for sub-word things (stems and affixes) is not intended to prevent modeling the latter class of theories.With regard to stems: Scalise (1986: 40; drawing on Aronoff 1976) lists the following characteristics of the 'Word Based Hypothesis' (in contradiction to a morpheme-based analysis):1. The bases of Word Formation Rules (WFRs, i.e. derivational affixation) are words, not morphemes. One issue here is whether words like perceive, deceive, conceive etc. should be broken down into meaningless morphemes per-, de-, con-, and ceive (note that ceive has the allomorph cept in nominalizations of all these words: perception etc.). Similarly with respect to words like strawberry (where berry has its expected meaning, but straw does not) and cranberry (where cran apparently has no meaning apart from this word). Another issue is whether words like serendipity and total are polymorphemic (serendip + i + ty and tot + al); Aronoff would claim they are not.2. These words must be existing words, as opposed to possible but non-existing words. For example, recitation cannot be derived from *recitate, nor approbation from *approbate. This suggests that we have a complex affix -ation.3. The base of a WFR must be a single word, not more (i.e. a phrase; clitics are thus a separate issue) or less (a bound form; see point (1) above).4. The input of a WFR must be a major category, i.e. N, V or A, or in some languages P. Adverbs are seldom discussed, but at least some adverbs (such as locatives and VP- or S-modifiers) would presumably be included under one of the other major categories. What is ruled out is that the base might be a category like determiner, 'particles', or an uninflectable adverb like very.5. The output of a WFR must be a major category.However, the term 'word' in the above has lead to confusion. Aronoff was not concerned in his 1976 book with inflectional affixation, so the term 'word' might be better understood as 'inflectional stem' or 'lexeme', i.e. the base to which inflectional affixes attach. Thus, if in some language, all words of a given category bear (overt) inflectional affixes, talking about the stems of that language does not violate the Word Based Hypothesis. What would violate the Word Based Hypothesis would be an analysis in which - ceive and - mit were stored in the lexicon as stems, and per-, de-, con- etc. were analyzed as prefixes attaching to such stems. Putting it differently, analyses which violate the criteria in points (1-3) might be seen as over-analysis. Thus, - ceive and - mit are not words (point 1), and they are certainly not existing words (point 2); at most, they are bound forms (point 3).The conceptual model given here does not actually prevent the user from doing morpheme-based morphology in violation of the Word Based Hypothesis, but neither is he encouraged to do so, since lexemes listed in the lexicon are expected to have meanings (senses) associated with them (issues 1-2).

			<para>Ordinarily, this would only be appropriate for stems which are not roots, hence it would be an attribute of MoStemMsa. I believe it is here on the superclass because under the stealth-to-wealth concept, the user may be in a state where he realizes something is composite, but has not yet worked out all the morphemes of which it is composed. This attribute could then be used to point to the parts that have already been discovered. Possibly when the user succeeds in completely decomposing the stem or composite affix, this object could go away, although it may be beneficial to retain it for future comparisons. Another possible use might be for a portmanteaux affix with a partial analysis, or for 'complex' affixes like the English ?ation (which under the Word Based Hypothesis, cannot be composed of the suffixes ?at and ?ion because of its appearance in words like recitation, since there is no word *recitate).</para>
			<para>I have defined this as an ordered seq on the assumption that the order of the components will match the left-to-right order of the morphemes. This is not unproblematic: some morphemes may be unanalyzed, and some morphemes may not appear in a strict left-to-right order (e.g. infixes). The former problem could be fixed by the use of placeholder (uninstantiated) Msas; the latter could be fixed either by defining a canonical order, or by using derivational order instead.</para>

		<para>Rules of Referral are used when one cell of a paradigm is realized in the same way as another cell-that is, to define syncretisms in a paradigm. Specifically, they are intended to describe syncretisms which cannot be captured by the use of underinstantiated morphosyntactic feature structures and disjunctive ordering of affixes. Typically, syncretisms appear in the more marked portions of the paradigm.</para>
		<para>As an example of a situation where referral rules are not necessary, suppose affix A marks the genitive case, affix B marks the dative case, and affix C is used elsewhere (perhaps in the nominative and accusative cases). This situation can be easily captured by the use of features and disjunctive ordering as follows: affix A realizes the morphosyntactic feature [genitive case], affix B realizes the feature [dative case], and affix C is not marked as realizing any morphosyntactic features-but crucially, it is ordered after affixes A and B. In this situation, there is no need for any rule of referral. An analysis using a default will always be possible where only a single feature is involved, and often in other situations.</para>
		<para>Another situation in which rules of referral are not necessary, is where the features realized by an affix constitute a natural class. For example, suppose a verb paradigm generally distinguishes singular and plural subject, as well as person of the subject, except that the second person singular and plural are represented by a single affix. While the other affixes mark feature values for both number and person, the second person affix can be seen as marking the natural class of second person.</para>
		<para>On the other hand, if a single affix marks, say, second person singular and third person plural, there is probably no natural class which captures these two categories. If these categories do not constitute an elsewhere case, then they would be candidates for a referral rule.</para>
		<para>Another situation in which a referral rule would be appropriate arises in an agglutinating language, where an entire syntagmatic series of affixes are the same for two positions in the paradigm. Stump (1993a) gives an example from Macedonian (see his table 2, page 452).</para>
		<para>Besides their ordinary use in capturing true cases of syncretism, rules of referral are also important in the context of stealth-to-wealth morphology. Specifically, the linguist can quickly capture syncretisms in a paradigm using rules of referral, and later decide whether there might be a more elegant way of capturing a syncretism using appropriate features, disjunctive ordering, and elsewhere cases.</para>
		<para>In the context of Stealth-to-wealth morphology, one way to initially assign a value to the Input and Output fields (defined below) of a Rule of Referral would be to select one or more cells in a paradigm as the Input, and one cell as the Output. The system could automatically remove any feature values from the output which were unchanged from the input, thereby simplifying the Output field. Later, the user could collapse several Rules of Referral which produced similar Outputs. For example, suppose a language has three genders, and that for each gender the accusative plural is syncretic with the corresponding nominative plural. Then as a first cut, the linguist might have three Rules of Referral, one for each gender. But these rules could be collapsed by removing the gender features from the inputs.</para>
		<para>Stump (1993a) discusses two kinds of rules of referral: 'broad rules', which say that one cell of a paradigm is realized in the same way as another cell; and 'narrow rules', which say that one rule (affix) is used in place of another. The difference is clearest in agglutinative systems (as opposed to so-called 'inflecting' languages, like Latin): under the narrow construal of rules of referral, it is possible for just one affix out of the sequence of affixes of a given word to be realized by a rule of referral. Under the broad construal, this cannot happen (or at least it cannot be said in quite those simple terms).</para>
		<para>Despite the limitations, I have defined rules of referral in this implementation to the 'broad' category. The reason is that 'narrow' rules of referral presuppose a more complicated sort of morphological rule system than what I am proposing here. Some of the effect of 'narrow' rules of referral could be obtained by allowing disjunction in the morphosyntactic feature specifications of Inflectional rules, which might be a simpler way to do it (and perhaps clearer for the user).</para>
		<para>In the theory of Distributed Morphology (see e.g. Halle and Marantz 1993; Noyer 1992, 1998; see also the discussion of the latter paper in Carstairs-McCarthy 1998a), rules of referral are replaced by rules of 'impoverishment', which (roughly speaking) delete morphosyntactic features from a word to be generated, rather than change them. I have not included rules of impoverishment in this model, on the assumption that working with such rules is probably too complex for most of our users, and that Distributed Morphology is a narrowly followed theory. (I'm sure its proponents wouldn't agree with me on that!)</para>

			<para>owns an FsFeatStruc, constituting the morphosyntactic feature values which must be present in a word in order for this Rule of Referral to apply.</para>
			<para>Often these features form an 'environment' which is not altered in the Output. However, this is true only if the input features are disjunctive with the output features. For instance, suppose in some language the nominative plural of nouns is syncretic with the nominative singular. Assuming singular and plural are the two possible values of 'number' in this language, this syncretism can be represented by a rule which has as input [case: nominative] and as output [number: singular]. But it is not always possible to make the input and output features disjunctive, particularly (but not only) where features are non-binary. For example, if the above syncretism held in a language which distinguished dual number, and the nominative dual was distinct from the singular (and plural) nominative forms, then it would be necessary to mention the 'number' feature both in the input and in the output, to prevent the rule from overapplying to the dual. It might be possible (and desirable) to have a view of rules of referral in which the input features which are unaffected in the output are distinguished (as a sort of environment) from the input features which are changed in the output.</para>

Note that the input and output fields may refer to the same features, albeit with different values. This is particularly likely for non-binary features (see Stump's rules (20) and (28), for example), but may also be necessary with binary features (e.g. Stump's rule (54b)). Accordingly, it would be possible to split the input features into a set of features whose values will be changed in the output, and a set of features which effectively form the environment for the change. This could even be done in the 'view' of the rule.</para>

		<para>This represents the allomorph of a root. A polymorphemic stem may however be represented here under some stealth-to-wealth situations (see discussion of MoMorphoSyntaxAnalysis.Components).</para>
		<para>There are issues here with the interaction between Item-and-Process morphology and the use of root allomorphs. Namely, what is the root chosen on the basis of, if affixes are added processually (that is, as morphological rules which modify the form of the base)? One algorithm would be to try all the allomorphs of the root, attach whatever affixes are to be attached, and see if the output form of the root remains unchanged (meaning that the form of the root originally chosen was "right"). However, that encounters problems in that it is not possible in general to discriminate the root in the surface form of a word to which processual affixes have been attached; there may be no clear boundary between root and affix. It may therefore be the case that the use of this class to account for allomorphy (i.e. having more than one root allomorph for a given root lexeme) should be restricted to Item-and-Arrangement morphology, where an algorithm like that used in STAMP would work. However, this has severe implications for stealth-to-wealth work, in that adding a single Item-and-Process affix would mean that any use of this MoStemAllomorph class would break (at least if the affix and the root allomorphs were morphosyntactically compatible).</para>

		<para>This represents one of the various inflectional stems used in a paradigm, other than the default stem. The assumption is that the stems with this stem name cannot be derived by a reasonable phonological rule (or at least that such a rule has not been written yet), and that the stem cannot be treated as an allomorph whose appearance is predictable by its phonological environment. Part of the stealth-to-wealth process consists of replacing such stems where possible with phonologically predictable allomorphs that do not have a particular stem name.</para>
		<para>Additional Notes about PARADIGMS:</para>
		<para>This describes the various classes in the Morphology model that have to do with paradigms. The term'paradigm&amp;apos here refers to the linguistic concept, not a sort of application for working with N-dimensional tables. (Bruce Waters has worked on the latter, and certainly table handling functionality will be necessary to work with linguistic paradigms.) The assumption here is that for some languages, paradigms will be a useful way of exploring the morphology. There is no class called /'Paradigm\'. Paradigms are instead treated as a sort of virtual attribute (see MoStemMsa.vParadigm). This is not intended to be a theoretical stand; some theories of morphology assign a fundamental status to paradigms (Carstairs 1987, Stump 1993a, 1993b), while others do not (Lieber 1992, Halle and Marantz 1993). The conceptual model defined in this document is intended to be compatible with both views.</para>

However, unlike an inflectional affix, it is possible for a stem to have more than one FsFeatStruc and therefore pertain to more than one contiguous region of a paradigm, i.e. a stem need have no particular (or at least no consistent) semantics over and above the semantics of the lexeme it belongs to.

			<para>If no DefaultStem is specified, then for any lexeme which does not explicitly list an (irregular) MoStemAllomorph with this stem name, the base for this MoStemName has the same form as the lexeme's (MoStemMsa's) DefaultStems.

Thus a regular stem for a given stem is constructed from the DefaultStem of that lexeme as specified by this MoStemName plus the DefaultAffix given by this MoStemName.

		<para>Strata are a concept borrowed from the theory of Lexical Phonology (see e.g. Kaisse and Shaw 1985); the term " level" is sometimes used synonymously. A given affix belongs to a single stratum; typically, a given phonological rule applies in a single stratum as well, but it is possible for a phonological rule to apply in a contiguous sequence of strata. The assumption that there can be a contiguous sequence of strata of course presupposes that the strata are arranged in a fixed linear order. Most versions of Lexical Phonology indeed made this assumption, but it was abandoned in some later versions (e.g. Inkelas and Orgun 1998).</para>
		<para>Inasmuch as phonological rules have not been defined yet for purposes of this application, the use of strata may seem superfluous. However, strata still may be useful for languages in which some derivational affixes appear outside of some inflectional affixes. That is, there would be a 'deeper' stratum for the inner inflectional affixes, and a shallower stratum for the derivational affixes in question, as well as for the outer inflectional affixes.</para>
		<para>The conceptual model makes no attempt to build in any universal or common properties of strata, or of their ordering. For example, it has been observed that for a number of languages, all derivational rules seem to precede all compounding rules (Scalise 1986: 115-122). This observation is not built in to the model, although it would be possible to ship a " starter" setup having this behavior.</para>

		<para>This class represents an expansion of the LinguaLinks authority list of parts of speech. The attributes given below represent only those attributes which are more or less relevant to the morphology, e.g. there is nothing here (yet) about phrase structure rules that the category might head or be made of (the latter in the case of compounding, if at least some compounds are to be treated syntactically). Nor is there any discussion here about phrasal categories, i.e. I discuss only X0 categories.The categories are arranged in an inheritance hierarchy, using the provision for hierarchies built in to the superclass of this class, CmPossibility. Thus, the categories of transitive and intransitive verbs could be subcategories of the category verb, etc. This brings up an interesting question with respect to phrasal categories, where the subcategories do not head distinct kinds of phrasal categories. (That is, languages do not treat VPs headed by transitive verbs differently from VPs headed by intransitive verbs.) I will not discuss this issue yet.The owner of the root of the part of speech hierarchy needs to implement a few of these attributes as virtual attributes returning none in order to stop the recursion, e.g. vAllInherentFeatureValues and vAllAffixSlots.Under some theories (cf. Chomsky 1970), the use of an atomic category is superfluous, given that atomic categories are treated as abbreviations for sets of morphosyntactic feature values. Even if we were to follow this approach, though, it seems likely that atomic categories would be useful in the context of the stealth-to-wealth approach.Note that attributes for name (cpName), abbreviation (cpAbbreviation), and subcategories (cpSubPossibilities) are inherited from the superclass CmPossibility, and are therefore not described here.</para>

Probably the latter is what is needed.</para>

		  <comment>
			<para>owns a collection seq of FsFeatStruc, indicating the cells (feature-value combinations) which are disallowed in the paradigm. This is intended to account for defective paradigms, which are not common (e.g. deponent verbs in Greek, which are verbs that have no active forms). Since defective paradigms are relatively rare, this will probably be a seldom-used attribute. It is not intended to account for syncretism in the paradigm, i.e. the situation where one cell 'uses' the affixes of another cell (for which MoReferralRules are supplied instead, should disjunctive ordering of the affixes in an MoInflAffixSlot not suffice.).Since this attribute is defined at the level of the part of speech, it is not possible to define cells which are empty in only one inflection class. It is not obvious that this is correct, e.g. it is not obvious that deponent verbs in Greek belonged to a separate part of speech from other verbs. Pluralia tantum words like scissors and trousers are another example, since it is not clear that they belong to a separate part of speech from other nouns. Yet another example of a set of words that cannot plausibly be assigned to a separate category comes from Russian. Halle (1973: 7-8) says there are about a hundred verbs, all in a particular conjugation class, which lack first person singular non-past forms. It is unclear what the status of this gap is; it may be semantically or pragmatically based (some of the glosses are 'I conquer', 'I talk rudely', 'I behave foolishly'). According to Halle, "Russian grammar books frequently note that such forms… 'do not exist', or 'are not used', or 'are avoided'." Perhaps this is more of a sociolinguistic issue. Jensen (1990: 117-119) discusses some other defective paradigms, although he admits that his Latin examples are suspect: the defective paradigm is based on the corpus of Latin literature, and it may be that the corpus, not the paradigm, is defective. Jensen also lists as examples a few French verbs which lack certain forms: "cloré ['to close, enclose']… lacks the passé simple and the first and second persons plural of the present. Gésir ['to lie'] lacks all tenses but the present and imperfect indicative, and lacks the first and second persons singular of the present." He notes that synonyms supply the missing forms, so these gaps probably cannot be explained on semantic or pragmatic grounds. Jensen also gives as examples English modal verbs, which lack participle and 'infinitive' (to V) forms. In this case, the customary solution is to create a separate part of speech (modals), as a subclass of the category Verb.There are at least two verbs in English with defective paradigms: sight-see (*sight-sees, *sight-saw, sight-seen-but sight-seeing), and beware (which occurs only in this base form. Another puzzle with respect to defective paradigms, is the fact that while the singular of pluralia tantum words is ungrammatical in isolation, they are found in compounds: scissor-handle and trouser-leg. It is not clear how a defective distribution of certain elements of the paradigm should be handled. Matthews (1972a: 197, fn. 2) suggests that defective paradigms be handled in the syntax, although it is unclear how this would work.</para>

This includes all the inflection classes relevant to this part of speech.There is no provision here for overriding the inflection classes of a super-category, although this could probably be done by assigning the same name to two inflection classes, then taking the 'unique' over the names. But it's not clear that this would ever be necessary or desirable. It's not even clear that combining inherited and owned inflection classes is a good idea, but given that (1) we will certainly want parts of speech to be able to inherit inflection classes (so e.g. we can define inflection classes for verbs, and let transitive and intransitive verbs inherit it), and that (2) we must allow parts of speech to own inflection classes, it's not clear what else we could do.</para>

		<owning num="5" id="AffixTemplates" card="seq" sig="MoInflAffixTemplate">
		  <comment>
			<para>owns an ordered seq of MoInflAffixTemplates, which define how affixation (but not choice of stems) works for this part of speech. The reason this is an ordered sequence attribute, rather than atomic, is to allow the user to capture the fact that the number of slots can be different for different parts of the paradigm (infinitives, for example, or tenses which are partly inflected on the main verb and partly on an auxiliary verb). The order of templates in this attribute is relevant: the first MoInflAffixTemplates whose Region attr is a subset of the inflectional features to be realized on the word, is chosen.Note the assumption here that all the words belonging to a single part of speech have fundamentally the same paradigm (and therefore the same set of affix templates), and that differences are accounted by membership in distinct MoInflectionClasses (Carstairs 1987: 10-11, Carstairs-McCarthy 1998b: 324). The fact that in languages which mark the verb for agreement with both subject and object, transitive verbs have different paradigms from intransitive verbs (transitives usually have an additional slot for object marking-or for subject marking, in the case of ergative languages), might seem to be a counterexample. The reason that is not a counterexample, is that transitive and intransitive verbs can be treated as separate parts of speech using the inheritance hierarchy.</para>

		<owning num="6" id="AffixSlots" card="col" sig="MoInflAffixSlot">
		  <comment>
			<para>owns a collection seq of MoInflAffixSlot, which may be referred to in MoInflAffixTemplates.The reason for having the ownership of Affix Slots reside here, rather than their being owned by the Affix Templates themselves, is to allow different Affix Templates to share Affix Slots. For example, suppose that in some language, both subject and object agreement are marked on the verb, and that the user has accordingly specified distinct parts of speech (and therefore distinct paradigms) for transitive and intransitive verbs. In all likelihood, most of the slots will be alike (tense and aspect marking, etc., and perhaps the subject agreement slot). The common affix slots can be shared if they are owned by the super-category verb (see the attribute vAllAffixSlots, below). Similarly, in Tzeltal nouns use the same prefixes for marking possessors as transitive verbs use for marking subjects. Assuming appropriate morphosyntactic features could be devised to represent the person of possessors and subject-of-transitives in Tzeltal, it would be nice to use the same MoInflAffixSlot for both. But this would be impossible, if the Affix Slots were owned by the Affix Templates (since nouns and verbs do not in general share those templates). It becomes possible if the Affix Slots are owned at some point in the part of speech inheritance hierarchy above noun and (transitive) verb, and referred to by the Affix Templates for these two categories.</para>
		  </comment>
		  <notes>
			<para>vAllAffixSlots: virtual attribute = [my affixSlots, allAffixSlots of my owner]. While there is no explicit provision for a category to override an affix slot inherited from its owner, an affix slot is effectively overridden if it is not used. For example, in Tzeltal (as discussed above), nouns and transitive verbs use the same prefix slot, which could be modeled by placing the ownership of this prefix slot at a point in the category hierarchy above noun and transitive verb. Because the prefix slot is stored there, it would also be inherited by intransitive verbs, which do not mark person with prefixes. But the fact that intransitive verbs do not use that slot is captured by the fact that the affix template for intransitive verbs does not refer to the prefix slot.</para>

		<owning num="7" id="StemNames" card="col" sig="MoStemName">
		  <comment>
			<para>owns a collection seq of MoStemNames, which define any non-default inflectional stems of the category (but not the default stem). For example, Aronoff (1992) discusses what he calls the '3-stem' of Latin verbs, a form which exists in all verb conjugations, and which is used as the base in a variety of places of the paradigm (which places are not identifiable on semantic or other grounds without using 'or'). The MoStemNames are interpreted as a disjunctively ordered list, i.e. in selecting a Stem for a given word, the list of StemNames is searched linearly, stopping at the first one for which one of its cells unifies with the FsFeatStruc of the word to be derived (see Choosing a Stem Allomorph). The order of the MoStemNames in this attribute is therefore important.If this attribute is empty, it defaults to the value of the same attribute in its owner. This allows e.g. defining a set of stem names for all verbs, and inheriting those names for subcategories of verb. It should probably be possible to block such inheritance without specifying any stem names, so there needs to be some specified value for that ('nil', say). An example might be modal verbs in English, which are presumably a subclass of verbs, but which lack certain forms.</para>

Usually, the reference forms belonging to a part of speech will suffice for all the MoInflectionClasses, i.e. a single "Primary Reference Form" (Carstairs-McCarthy's term). In some cases, however, it may prove necessary to provide a secondary reference form to distinguish among "mixed" classes (see again the discussion in Carstairs-McCarthy 1991.) Any secondary reference forms are provided in the attr of the same name of the particular MoInflectionClasses to which they pertain.Note that this attribute performs no particular function in any of the algorithms used for computing affixed forms. However, it may be useful in the context of a dictionary, e.g. for providing principal parts.</para>

According to Wurzel (as described in Carstairs-McCarthy 1998b), the default class is the Inflection Class to which newly coined lexemes are usually assigned, to which lexemes from other classes 'drift' in the process of historical change, and the class to which children tend to assign lexemes before they learn the correct class. For our purposes, however, it may be simpler just to think of the default class as being the largest class numerically, i.e. the class to which words in the lexical database are assigned as a first guess.</para>

		<para>This represents the application of a single MoCompoundRule, i.e. the morphological combination of any two stems. The stems are represented as two stems in the lexicon. Any further affixation is assumed to be attached to the head member of the compound, if this is an endocentric compound (i.e. the rule is of the class MoEndocentricCompound). If this is an exocentric compound (the rule is of the class MoExocentricCompound), then further affixation is applied to the entire word. Any phonological rules of the appropriate strata (the stratum of the compounding rule and all higher strata) will be applied.</para>
		<para>An alternative to having the members of the compound be stems, would be to allow the members to be MoDerivation objects. This would allow words or stems which were not stored in the lexicon. In their present form, MoDerivations are intended to contain a derivation beginning with an underlying form and ending at a surface form. If they could also be used inside compounds, the final form would usually be of a non-surface stratum.</para>

		<para>This class and its subclasses give a regular expression notation. They are used in the environments of phonological rules, and in the input and output of morphological and phonological rules. Since regular expressions are ubiquitous in NLP (the right-hand side of phrase structure rules, for example), it would ideally not be necessary to define classes for the elements of regular expressions. Instead, they would be a built-in possibility for attribute signatures (along with atomic and sequence attrs). The difficulty in generalizing the regular expression notation using classes, is that of ensuring that the 'fillers' belong to the appropriate model. For example, it should not be possible to mix contexts referring to phonological and morphosyntactic features.</para>

			<para>Refers to a collection seq of PhFeatureConstraint. The use of a plusConstraint only makes sense if there are two or more contexts in a rule that make use of the same constraint. If two such constraints occur in the environment of the rule (treating the input as part of the environment), then the feature referred to by the constraint is required to have the same value in every place where the word matches the pattern. For example, if a plusConstraint for the feature voiced appears on two adjacent consonant contexts in a rule, then the word being matched must have two adjacent consonants with identical voicing. If one of the constraints is in the environment and one in the output of the rule, then the effect is that of a rule of assimilation: in the form output by the rule, the phoneme affected by the rule will have the same value as the value on the phoneme matched by the environment.This attribute is not intended to be implemented immediately, but is included here for completeness (since it is apparently difficult to add new attributes once a COM interface has been defined).Note that although this attr is defined as a collection seq (not an ordered seq), the order is assumed to be stable. Otherwise the labels used in SPE-style rules would be subject to change. On the other hand, the use of a seq attr here may be overkill; from a linguistic standpoint, a single constraint (plus or minus) might be adequate.</para>

		<para>assumption here is that there is a way to convert between the representation of the form of a WfiWordform as a string in some encoding, and a sequence of phonemes (and perhaps boundary markers).

			<para>a collection of PhCodes (which amounts to a seq of strings), each in a single encoding (but not perhaps all in the same encoding). Each string is a representation of the phoneme or boundary marker in that encoding.</para>
		  </comment>
		  <notes>
			<para>There is not guaranteed to be a unique representation of a phoneme in a single encoding. For example, in Spanish the strings 'c' (in certain contexts), 'qu', and 'k' (in a handful of words) represent the /k/ phoneme. One implication of this is that the translation from phoneme to string will not be unique: the translation may be context sensitive, as in Spanish, or it could be indeterminate, as in English orthography. A work-around for the situation in which the translation is context-sensitive, is to treat the two strings as if they were two different phonemes (which will both happen to belong to the same natural classes, i.e. PhNCSegments). Capitalization provides another example of this problem, since a single phoneme will be represented by both upper- and lower-case letters.Likewise, there is not guaranteed to be a unique phoneme for a given string. There are at least two ways this form of uniqueness might be violated. First, a single string might stand for two or more phonemes, depending on the context. For example, in (Latin American) Spanish the string 'c' represents the phoneme /s/ before a front vowel, and the phoneme /k/ elsewhere. Second, a sequence of letters might be ambiguous in terms of its division into strings representing phonemes. For example, in English the letters 'sh' can represent a single phonological unit, as in the word 'ship'; or they may represent two units, as in 'mishap'.Provided the departures from biuniqueness are predictable (as in Spanish, but not in English), it is possible to provide a fairly simple translator between the two representations (a finite state transducer, for example). Conceptually, it would handle simple rewrite rules like the following:'c' /s/ / __ i, e /k/ / __'qu' /k/ __ i, e'z' /s/ I have not specified in these examples whether the symbols in the environments are phonemes or strings. Note that it is necessary to define the positions in which 'qu' represents /k/ (or alternatively, where 'c' represents /k/), in order to preserve biuniqueness. (Otherwise, the translation of /k/ would be ambiguous.) The translation between /s/ and 'z', on the other hand, does not require that an environment be stated. The general guideline is that there can be only one 'elsewhere' case for each translation, in both directions.Concerning the translation between phonemes and strings, see also http://intranet.sil.org/softwaredev/Projects/CELLARII/Design/ConceptualModel/Encodings/CLR2_EncodingRequirements.html - RcmEnc5.3.

For the purposes of this document, it is sufficient to treat units of the encoding which have some linguistic reality as if they were phonemes. One implication is that two different spellings of the same phoneme (e.g. Spanish 'c' and 'qu' for the phoneme /k/) correspond to one phoneme.It is likely that some attributes (such as a featural decomposition) will be added later, as needed for phonology applications.

		<para>An abstract class for the various kinds of natural classes. Note that the subclasses have several attrs in common (e.g. stratum), but that these attrs are defined differently in the various subclasses.Attributes: In addition to the attr given here, all subclasses define a segments attr, either as a ref or a virtual attr, depending on whether the subclass is defined intensionally or extensionally.

		<para>In general, a phonological Natural Class is a set of phonemes that undergo similar sorts of phonological processes, or which condition similar processes. In classical generative phonology (the SPE model), a natural class was presumed to be specifiable by a small number of feature values. In feature geometry models of phonology (such as autosegmental phonology), a natural class is assumed to be specifiable by a feature node, i.e. by one or more feature values dominated exhaustively and exclusively by a single node. Natural classes defined intensionally are represented here by the subclass PhNCFeatures. Natural classes may also be defined extensionally, by simply listing their members, using the subclass PhNCSegments.These classes may be more generally useful, and might belong in the Feature System model, rather than here.</para>

		<para>A natural class picked out by specifying the segments which are members (i.e. an extensional definition). This was not an option in classical generative phonology (e.g. SPE = Chomsky and Halle 1968), and opens the possibility of abuse, i.e. setting up unnatural natural classes. It is included here to support the stealth-to-wealth process by letting the user set up a preliminary natural class based on intuitions.

		<para>This class appears here for purposes of future development; it is not intended to be implemented immediately. It will serve for constraints requiring agreement or disagreement with respect to a single feature or a set of features all dominated by a single nonterminal node (e.g. the set of features under a 'place' node), and for rules of assimilation and dissimilation. It resembles the use of alpha variables in SPE, and the use of linking conventions in autosegmental phonology.In the SPE convention, the features within a given rule which are meant to agree or disagree are labeled consecutively with Greek letters (with the letters being preceded by a minus sign for disagreement). This requires some mechanism in the rule itself for labeling constraints; the labels would appear as part of the PhFeatureConstraints, but would not actually represent an attribute of the constraints. In autosegmental phonology, (positive) PhFeatureConstraints within a rule are joined by a line (and must obey certain adjacency constraints). Negative constraints as such do not exist in autosegmental phonology; dissimilation is instead seen as the result of unlinking, followed by the insertion of a default feature value.This class may be more generally useful, e.g. for person/number agreement in syntax. In that case, this class should probably be defined in the Feature System model, rather than here.</para>

			<para>refers to an FsFeatureDefnPhFeatureNode, the feature with respect to which the constraint ensures agreement (or disagreement).The use of an atomic attr, rather than a seq attr, emulates to a certain extent the insight of autosegmental phonology and feature geometry that a rule can change (or refer to in the environment) only a single feature node. Note however that the fact that the feature can be a nonterminal feature (an FsComplexFeature), allows agreement with respect to a number of features dominated by a single node (e.g. a place of articulation feature, which might dominate the features labial, coronal, and back).</para>

		<para>This is the ultimate owner of phonological data, parallel to the MoMorphologicalData object in the Morphology model. In particular, PhPhonemeSets, PhEnvironments, and PhNaturalClasses are owned here. The reason for the ownership of these objects residing here, rather than in the MoForm (allomorphs) or phonological rules where they are used, is to allow for their re-use. For example, a step in going from an allomorph-based description to a phonological rule-based description is to find all the allomorphs that have similar environments. This step is expedited if the environments are re-used (since they will be identical). Even if they are not identical, the fact that they all reside in one location makes them easier to search for similar environments.</para>

		<para>This is intended to capture co-occurrence restrictions between allomorphs which cannot be (or has not yet been) captured using morphosyntactic or phonological restrictions.</para>
		<para>There are some problems with this class as it stands. The use of the value Anywhere in the Adjacency attr serves to constrain any two or more allomorphs from cooccurring in a single word, whereas the use of the other possibilities in that attr only serves to constrain a set of two or more allomorphs from cooccuring with a single allomorph. This inconsistency could be eliminated by making Anywhere work like the other possibilities (but that would make it less useful), or by replacing the single Allomorphs attr with two attrs, one for one set of allomorphs, and one for another set. The co-occurrence restriction would then be between any allomorph from the first set and any allomorph from the second (and the meaning of the values SomewhereToLeft and SomewhereToRight would be clarified). This would of course have the disadvantage of making this class non-parallel to the class MoMorphemeAdhocCoProhibition.</para>
		<para>Another problem with this class is that there is no way to constrain what sorts of things can occur between the allomorphs with any of the values Anywhere, SomewhereToLeft and SomewhereToRight. For example, processes such as vowel harmony and nasal assimilation are often blocked by affixes with exceptional values for the features in question. This can be indicated by suitable phonological environments, but not by the use of an allomorph co-occurrence constraint.</para>

			<para>Since the parts of speech are contained in an inheritance hierarchy, a question arises: if this MSA points to an abstract part of speech (verb, say), does a word with a more specific part of speech (transitive verb, say) match?

			<para>Note also that this attribute has two different functions.</para>
			<para>1. If a gloss item is a cross-reference, it needs a target attribute to point to a the preferred term in the master gloss list. A cross-reference item lists a term that the user would be looking for, but redirects the user to a standardized term elsewhere in the tree.</para>
			<para>2. An additional status is added to indicate that a gloss item that has been copied into a subtree under a complex feature is a proxy for the original gloss item in the master gloss list. A proxy item uses the target attribute to point to its source item. No other attributes on a proxy item should be used since the values on the target item are its values.

		<para>A LexEntryRef object is a general purpose link from a variant or complex entry to one or more major entries. It also classifies the link using variant and/or complex entry types that determine how the references are displayed (e.g., minor entry or subentry, and the abbreviations associated with the reference). The UI may restrict what gets used in a particular LexEntryRef. For example, for a variant entry, the UI might limit VariantEntryTypes to a single type and PrimaryLexemes to a single entry while hiding ComplexEntryTypes and ComponentLexemes. For complex entries it might limit ComplexEntryTypes to a single type and hide VariantEntryTypes. On the other hand, the UI could make all of these available so the user could set combinations of variant and complex entries from a single LexEntryRef when they refer to the same major entries.</para>

			<para>This points to one or more LexEntryType items in the Variant Entry Types list for variant entries. It is unused for complex entries, although the model allows for both to be used if desirable. Normally a variant LexEntryRef will only use PrimaryLexemes to point to a single entry or sense. Entries using VariantEntryTypes will be displayed as minor entries in the dictionary; usually following the main entry headword and will typically produce a separate minor entry in the dictionary referring to the main entry. The LexEntryType is used to determine how to display the variant information in the main entry context as well as the minor entry context. The Variant Entry Types list is hierarchical with the top level being the type of variant (e.g., dialectal) and subitems being the conditions (e.g., British English, American English) for that type of variant. Normally the user will set this property to a subitem, although a top level item could be used if the user does not want to specify the condition. Each LexEntryType Abbreviation and ReverseAbbr should contain everything needed for displaying the references for this entry. Flex will not attempt to combine names from different hierarchical levels. The Abbreviation is used when displaying the main entry from the minor entry (e.g., Brit. dial. of color). The ReverseAbbr is used when displaying the minor entry from the main entry (e.g., Brit. dial. colour). This is a sequence because some minor entries can have more than one relationship to the same main entry. For example, colour is a spelling variant and a British dialectal variant. The user could use two LexEntryRefs to represent this, but it would be easier to use a single LexEntryRef with two VariantEntryTypes references.</para>

			<para>This property points to one or more items in the Complex Entry Types list for complex entries. It is unused for variant entries, although the model allows for both to be used if desirable. Normally a complex LexEntryRef will point to more than one main entry or sense via PrimaryLexemes and ComponentLexemes. Entries using ComplexEntryTypes will be displayed as subentries in the dictionary; usually at the end of the major entry and will typically produce a separate major entry in the dictionary referring to the main entry. The display is dependent on whether a root-based or stem-based view of the dictionary is being printed. The referenced LexEntryType is used to control the display of the complex information in the main entry context as well as the minor entry context.

		  <comment>
			<para>This field indicates whether the variant or compound entry should be listed as a minor entry referencing the main entry in the lexicon. The lexicographer typically wants to limit minor entries to ones that are not alphabetically close to the main entry. It defaults to 0 which is easiest to implement in the model and is probably the most common situation. The UI for this could say Show Minor Entry, if desired. If there are multiple LexEntryRefs in the same entry, the entry will show as a minor entry unless all of the LexEntryRefs have HideMinorEntry set to 1. The minor entry would only display information for LexEntryRefs that have this property set to 0. For example, we could limit a reference on a minor entry (e.g., Entry: man (pl. men) Entry: people (reg. var. men) Minor Entry: men pl. of man, but not reg. var. of people) I don’t think this is a good example, but I suspect someone might have a productive derivation where they would only want to list a few of the references in the minor entry. By leaving this property on LexEntryRef, this would be possible. If we are certain that everyone will always want to list every occurrence in a minor entry for a variant or a subentry, then we could add this to LexEntry instead of LexEntryRef. We are using an integer instead of a Boolean for the possibility of controlling printing for different dictionary publications. Each bit in the integer could represent a Boolean for a particular dictionary, thus allowing 32 different dictionaries. We are not implementing the support for multiple dictionaries at this point, and the final design may use a different means for controlling minor entries.</para>

			<para>This field is available for summary information to show with the variant info being displayed from the main entry. It may be in more than one language and might support formatting and embedded languages. Chuck Grimes feels this is important and it is not simply the gloss of the variant entry. This field would contain the MDF \ve, \vn, and \vr information, which may be the name of a dialect and/or any pertinent comment, such as usage restrictions, simple gloss, or inflection. In MDF the contents of \ve is displayed after the variant in parentheses. Since the \ve field is imported from the major entry, and the \ve may differ for the same \va used in different entries, by storing the information with the LexEntryRef we do not lose anything. If we imported it into the SummaryDefinition of the minor entry, we would have to concatenate the various \ve fields and would lose the distinction of which reference they came from. However, my searches so far have not uncovered any place two different main entries refer to the same variant entry, If this does not happen, we could probably ignore this and just use the SummaryDefinition of the minor entry. When displaying the variant entry in a main entry, this summary could be printed following the variant headword. When displaying a subentry in a main entry in the stem-based format, this summary would be displayed following the subentry headword. Would we ever need a different summary for two different LexEntryRefs owned by the same entry? If not, we could do without this property.</para>

		<para>As currently designed, the rules resemble those of classical generative phonology, in that the input, output, and environments are defined in terms of phonetic features (not segments or autosegments).</para>
		<para>There is currently no concept of disjunctive rules, although that could be added.</para>
		<para>We support rule features (i.e. nonphonetic features, such as the feature [+Latinate] of SPE) and rules which are sensitive to the part of speech of the word to which they apply.</para>
		<para>A phonological rule may act as either an allophonic or morphophonemic rule in structuralist phonology would.</para>
		<para>We allow for (phonological) metathesis rules, also.</para>

			<para>For regular rules, this is the structural description of the rule (i.e the A in the general formula of A -&gt; B / C _ D). If A is missing, then this is an insertion (epenthetic) rule. For metathesis rules, this is the structural description (i.e. the input) of the rule.

			<para>In traditional interlinearizing programs, the user is encouraged to provide a part-of-speech or category for all morphemes in a word. Inflectional affixes such as PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE might be labelled as tense. Derivational affixes often take labels very similar to their glosses - CAUSATIVE might be labelled as causative or causative marker or simply verb affix. The AffixCategoryList is provided here to allow the user to label affixes in this way for "stealth" purposes only. Inflectional affixes should ultimately be captured in inflectional templates and slot names used for interlinearizing. Derivational affixes should be default have a MoAffixCategory of "derv" (derivational affix). Refer to MoInflectionalAffixMsa and MoDerivationalAffixMsa for more information.</para>
