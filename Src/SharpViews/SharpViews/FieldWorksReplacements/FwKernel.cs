	///  one used to draw. Accordingly, routines responsible for actual drawing are given
	///  two rectangles, rcSrc and rdDst, which allow an appropriate transformation.

	///  any other measurements based on the device context used to create it and lay it
	///  out (referred to as source coordinates).
	///  To map a point from this to where it should actually be drawn, in the coordinate
	///  system of the VwGraphics where drawing will take place, we do the following:
	///  subtract rcSrc.Origin
	///  multiply by rcDst.

	/// Interface ILgWritingSystem
	/// An LgWritingSystem represents one way of writing data in a particular language
	/// (or dialect). It has a number of engines which implement various aspects of writing
	/// system behavior.
	///
	/// ENHANCE: May need some more 'documentation' type attributes, such as
	/// an author, region, countrywhat exactly is useful?
	///
	/// <h3>When to implement</h3>
	/// Clients should not implement this interface.
	///
	/// <h3>When to use</h3>
	/// Use this class when you need to get one of the engines or other bits of information
	/// it stores about an writing system. In some cases, if you need only one engine, it is
	/// simpler to ask the <c>LgWritingSystemFactory</c> for it in a single step.
	///
	/// Don't use an ILgWritingSystem when you just need to identify an writing system, but
	/// don't actually need any of the engines. Use the integer which stands for the writing
	/// system.
	///
	/// <h3>How to obtain an instance</h3>
	/// Normally, use the get_Engine method of an <c>LgWritingSystemFactory</c>. This will create
	/// and writing system with all default engines if one does not already exist. To avoid
	/// this, use get_EngineOrNull instead.
	///
	/// Hungarian: <c>ws or wseng</c>
	/// (Note: use wseng when you need to distinguish the interface/object from the writing
	/// system's integer code, which uses ws as its Hungarian.)

	/// thousands separator, exponential notation, and minus. You must QueryInterface
	/// for ISimpleInit and pass an initialization string to set up the special characters.
	/// For example,
	///
	/// <code>
	/// IClassInitMonikerPtr acim;
	/// qcim.CreateInstance(CLSID_LgNumericEngine);
	/// CheckHr(qcim&gt;InitNew((BYTE)L".,E", 4 isizeof(wchar)));

	/// ENHANCE JohnT: do we need something analogous to Locales? For example, Australia, US
	/// and Great Britain all use English, but use different date and currency
	/// conventions. They don't actually do numbers differently, but other similar
	/// situations could require that.
	///
	/// ENHANCE JohnT: do we need similar routines for doubles? Do they have languagespecific
	/// formats?
	///
	/// ENHANCE JohnT: do we need a similar engine (or part of this?) for currencies and dates?
	///
	/// ENHANCE JohnT: do we need this at all? Or can we just record a locale in the writing
	/// system and use standard system number formatting?
	///
	/// <h3>When to implement</h3>
	/// Only if you need a number representation that can't be done with any of the standard
	/// approaches.
	///
	/// <h3>When to use</h3>
	/// Use this interface when you need to convert numbers to and from binary in a language dependent way.
	///
	/// <h3>How to obtain an instance</h3>
	/// If we decide to proceed with this notion, there will need to be a method on writing
	/// system to return one. For now the only way is to create one using CoCreateInstance,
	/// with CLSID_LgNumericEngine. This creates a very simple engine that does decimal
	/// numbers but can be customized as to which characters it uses for decimal separator,
	/// thousands separator, exponential notation, and minus. You must QueryInterface
	/// for ISimpleInit and pass an initialization string to set up the special characters.
	/// For example,
	///
	/// <code>
	/// IClassInitMonikerPtr acim;
	/// qcim.CreateInstance(CLSID_LgNumericEngine);
	/// CheckHr(qcim&gt;InitNew((BYTE)L".,E", 4 isizeof(wchar)));
