// This file was previously generated by the Nant target 'GenerateFilesFromModel-build' from CmTypes.txt
// We chose not to reimplement this process using MSBuild.
// In the unlikely event of changes to this, consistent changes should be made to CmTypes.txt
// so they will also appear in the similar (currently still generated) C++ header, CellarBaseConstants.h.
// Also change FDO/CellarBaseConstants.h, which will be the C++ version in the new model.
