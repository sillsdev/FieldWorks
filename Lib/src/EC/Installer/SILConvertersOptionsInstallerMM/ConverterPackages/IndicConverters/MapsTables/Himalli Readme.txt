Notes re "Himal(l)i(ll)[PC|Mac].map" files.

There are numerous versions of the Himalli font floating around. Some are PC fonts, some are Mac fonts, some have had extra characters added to them, etc. The encodings do not all match up. (In fact, I have not found two fonts that match exactly). When you get a file containing text in one of these fonts, it's not easy to know what encoding is actually being used, and therefore which mapping to use.

It will probably take trial and error, but below are the fonts I know about, and mappings to go with them. It's possible that a font with a different filename and/or date could match one of these encodings, but it won't be easy to determine that.

HimalliPC-1998.map - for use with PC files using the PC Himalli font named himalli.ttf dated 12-May-1998.
HimalliPC-2002.map - for use with PC files using the PC Himalli font named himalli_.ttf (note underscore)
					 dated 18-Dec-2002.
HimalliLLPC.map    - for use with PC files using the Himallill font named Himallil.ttf, dated 11-Dec-2001.
HimalliMac.map     - for use with files that use the Mac version of Himalli font.
HimalliLLMac.map   - for use with files that use the Mac version of Himallill font.


NB: There is also a mapping called HimaliNew.map (note one 'l') which is for use with the Himali New font. This is unrelated to the above Himalli (two 'l's) fonts. Himali follows the old Annapurna 1.0 encoding, which is different from Annapurna 5 in seven places.
