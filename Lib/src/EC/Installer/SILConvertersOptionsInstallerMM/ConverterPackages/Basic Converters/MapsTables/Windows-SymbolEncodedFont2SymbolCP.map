; Windows SymbolFont to CP_42 'narrow' transliterator
;
; This map has the effect of stripping off the high (0xF0) byte and returning
; narrow data that is consistent with the (symbol) code page 42.
;
; It's useful for a situation like this:
; Suppose a user opened an SFM document containing IPA93 data in Word and
; applied the SILDoulos IPA93 font (so that Word would now store it as 0xFF..
; values). Then without using the IPA93<>UNICODE converter, they saved the
; document as UTF-8 (thinking that might convert it to Unicode). Since
; 0xFF.. is valid "unicode" data (even though the data is *not*
; unicode), this will be properly stored (though incorrectly interpreted).
;
; To solve this, they could open the SFM document using the Bulk SFM Converter
; (opening the file as Unicode) and create a daisy-chain compound converter
; for which the first step is this SymbolFont2SymbolCP (Unicode<>Legacy)
; converter, which will get the data properly back to single byte legacy
; data, followed by the SIL IPA93<>UNICODE converter which will properly
; take those single bytes into a proper Unicode interpretation.
