# Grammar Sketch Generation

## Purpose

Describe the workflow for generating grammar sketches from morphology data.

## User Stories

- As a linguist, I want to generate grammar sketches using shared transforms.
- As a maintainer, I want sketch generation to stay aligned with morphology data.

## Context

Grammar sketch generation uses XSLT transforms and morphology data exports.

## Behavior

- Sketch outputs are generated by shared transforms.
- Morphology data provides the source for sketch generation.

### References

- [Transforms](../../../../Src/Transforms/AGENTS.md#key-components) — Morphology sketch transforms
- [Morphology UI](../../../../Src/LexText/Morphology/AGENTS.md#purpose) — Morphology data sources

## Constraints

- Keep sketch transforms aligned with current morphology schema.
- Avoid creating duplicate sketch generators outside shared transforms.

## Anti-patterns

- Generating sketches with outdated transform versions.

## Open Questions

- Should sketch generation be surfaced in UI workflows?
