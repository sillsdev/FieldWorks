  VSTest Exit Code Interpretation:
  ================================
  Exit code 0: All tests passed, no skipped tests
  Exit code 1: Tests failed OR tests were skipped (VSTest treats skipped as non-zero)
  Exit code -1073741819 (0xC0000005): Access violation during cleanup
    - This is mitigated by InIsolation mode below, but may still occur in edge cases
    - Check test output for "Passed/Failed/Skipped" counts to determine actual results

  To reliably interpret results:
  1. Look for "Test Run Successful" or "Test Run Failed" in output
  2. Count "Passed", "Failed", "Skipped" lines in output
  3. Exit code 1 with 0 failed is success (just has skipped tests)

      InIsolation: Run tests in a separate process.
      This prevents native COM cleanup crashes from affecting VSTest's exit code.
      FieldWorks tests use native interop (VwCacheDa, ICU, etc.) that can crash
      during process shutdown if COM pointers are released after native DLLs unload.

    IMPORTANT: External NuGet Package Test Exclusion
    ================================================
    The SIL.LCModel.Tests, SIL.LCModel.Core.Tests, and SIL.LCModel.Utils.Tests NuGet
    packages contain liblcm's own unit tests (2,488 tests total). These should NOT
    be run as part of FieldWorks testing because:
    1. They test liblcm internals, not FieldWorks code
    2. They have dependency version conflicts (DependencyModel 2.0.4 vs FW's 9.0.9)
    3. They're already tested in liblcm CI

    The FieldWorks.targets MSBuild file already specifies exact test DLLs to run.
    If using vstest.console.exe directly, exclude these assemblies:
      vstest.console.exe *.Tests.dll /TestCaseFilter:"FullyQualifiedName!~SIL.LCModel.Tests&FullyQualifiedName!~SIL.LCModel.Core.Tests"

    See: https://jira.sil.org/browse/LT-XXXXX for upstream fix request
