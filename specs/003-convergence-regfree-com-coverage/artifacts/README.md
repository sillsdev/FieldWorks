# Artifacts Directory

All evidence produced by the RegFree COM tooling flows lives here. The following conventions keep the folder auditable:

| File                          | Producer                        | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `com_usage_report.csv`        | `audit_com_usage.py`            | Tabular view of every executable, detected COM indicators, and priority flags.                                             |
| `com_usage_detailed.log`      | `audit_com_usage.py`            | Full-text log with the matched indicators, file names, and timestamps.                                                     |
| `*_validation.log`            | `validate_regfree_manifests.py` | Manifest XML + COM class verification output for each executable.                                                          |
| `*-vm.md` / `vm-output/*.log` | `run-in-vm.ps1`                 | Clean-VM run transcripts and screenshots (referenced from the corresponding integration test markdown files).              |
| `*-dev.md`                    | Manual runs                     | Developer-machine regression evidence, including complex script coverage results.                                          |
| `*-manifests.md`              | Manual runs                     | Checksums, manifest paths, and build configuration used for each executable group (user tools, migration utilities, etc.). |
| `installer-validation.log`    | Installer build                 | Logs captured while running `Build/Orchestrator.proj /t:BuildBaseInstaller`.                                               |
| `ValidationRunSummary.md`     | Phase 7                         | Aggregated pointers to every evidence artifact listed above.                                                               |

## Retention Rules

- CSV/JSON/log outputs are kept indefinitely for auditing; rotate by deleting files older than two releases only after the summary has been refreshed.
- VM payload logs belong under `vm-output/` with timestamped filenames generated by `run-in-vm.ps1`.
- Large screenshots or binary captures should be stored outside the repo (e.g., SharePoint) with markdown files in this folder linking to them.

## Naming

Use `<exe>-<context>-<yyyymmdd-hhmmss>.{log,md}` where `context` is `audit`, `validation`, `vm`, or `dev`. This ensures we can correlate evidence with a specific build/test run.
