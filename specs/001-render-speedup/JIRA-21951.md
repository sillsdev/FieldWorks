Analyze the performance of views code specifically the layout and drawing and see if AI code assist can help with changes to improve it.

The performance analysis did not reveal any specific problems in the views drawing code. It appears that the bulk of the performance issues is in the design of the DataTree. The DataTree was designed to be very flexible and malleable so it does a lot of discovery and creation of controls. This conflicts with the Winforms design in which layout and control creation can be expensive.
The controls are disposed of and recreated on every switch between entries. The entries have different data so there are points in the view which will be drastically different between entries.
I think in order to improve performance DataTree will need a complete redesign, this redesign may actually need to include a replacement of the whole Views engine. The views code its self is not actually the performance issue, but it is a complication in any redesign.

Currently the xml describing the fields in the data tree is parsed on each entry using both the xml layout and the object to fill in all the controls.
All the slices are disposed and then created for the new entry. In order to allow for Control reuse and quicker layout adjustment a design which makes a better separation between the viewing code, the data model, and the view model is needed.

The layout and parts xml can be considered the current view model.
liblcm provides the data model.
The current Slices take actual xml nodes and hvo and flids as arguments. This means that they have members representing both the view and the view model.
The model information is passed down all the way into the views classes. There is the 'VC' views controller at the lowest level of most controls and this does the actual drawing of the model content by looking it up through the hvo and flid.

The attached project (specs\011-faster-winforms\Slow 2026-01-14 1140.fwbackup), demonstrates a significant part of the slowdown with a single entry that has multiple senses and subsenses. A refresh of the view with this single entry takes longer than one second to display it.
