\tqref ACT 1.1-5
\bttq What information did Luke, the writer of this book, give in this introduction?
\tqe Luke reminded his readers that he was about to continue the true story about Jesus and his apostles that Luke had written in his first book. (1)
\tqe He also reminded his readers that Jesus had promised that his Father would send his followers the Holy Spirit. (5)
\bttq What do you think an apostle of Jesus is?
\tqe Key Term Check: To be an apostle of Jesus means to be a messenger/ambassador, who represents Jesus, who proclaims the message about Jesus. (See "apostle" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think it means to make a promise?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that someone will make a declaration that he will do or will refrain from doing something specified. (See "promise" in KBT in the "covenant" entry.)
\dh Details
\bttq To whom did the writer of Acts address this book?
\tqe He addressed this book to a person whom he respected. The person's name was Theophilus. (1-2)
\bttq What do you think is the reason for a person or place to have a name?
\tqe Key Term Check: A name is a label that identifies a person or place. (See "name" in KBT.)
\bttq What had the writer written about in his first book?
\tqe In his first book the writer had told about all the things that Jesus did and taught while he lived on earth. (1-2)
\bttq What did Jesus do in the forty days just before he returned to heaven?
\tqe The Holy Spirit guided Jesus as Jesus gave the men, whom he had chosen as apostles, teaching/commands/instructions beyond what he had given them before that time. (1-3)
\bttq Where do you think heaven is?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is that part of God's creation above the earth and the waters, including "air" and "space," and serves as home for God and the spirits who serve Him. (See "heaven" in KBT.)
\bttq Who do you think the Holy Spirit is?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is God's spirit through whom he acts, reveals His will, and empowers individuals. (See "Holy Spirit" in KBT in the "spirit" entry.)
\bttq How did the apostles of Jesus know that Jesus was truly alive again?
\tqe He showed himself to them many times in ways that convinced them that he was truly alive again. (3)
\bttq What did Jesus talk to them about during those forty days?
\tqe He continued to teach them about the kingdom of God. (3)
\bttq What do you think the kingdom of God is?
\tqe Key Term Check: The kingdom of God, rather than being a territory over which God rules, is the presence of God ruling in the lives of men. (See "kingdom of God" in KBT.)
\bttq For what reason had Jesus again talked with his apostles about the kingdom of God?
\tqe Jesus was preparing the apostles to tell people about him in all parts of the earth. They would begin spreading the message about him after they received the Holy Spirit. (3)
\an (Note: See 1:6-8.)
\bttq For what reason did Jesus tell the apostles to wait in Jerusalem?
\tqe He told them to continue to wait in Jerusalem for a few days, until [God], his Father, sent them the Holy Spirit. (4-5)
\bttq Who do you think God is?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is the supreme being to be worshipped. In English, the term "God" with a capital "g" is used to refer to the one supreme Creator. The term "god" with a small "g", as in "a god" or "many gods", can refer to any spiritual being that people worship. The Greek word theos can be used in the same two ways.
\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralized. (Or, if it can be pluralized, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)
\bttq To what did Jesus compare the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles?
\tqe Jesus compared receiving the Holy Spirit to being baptized with water by John the Baptist. (4-5)
\bttq What do you think happens when someone is baptized?
\tqe Key Term Check: In ordinary language the Greek verb baptizô (and related words) had both literal and figurative uses. The literal sense of baptizô was "to plunge or drench or immerse something", usually in water. In religious contexts, however, it came to have two more specific senses:
\an (a) To wash someone or something in or with water to make him or it ceremonially clean.
\an (b) To wash someone in or with water as part of their initiation into the religious community. When a person is baptized he is showing publicly his commitment to and union with Jesus Christ. (See "baptize, baptism" in KBT.)
\bttq Can you think of a reason for which Jesus implied that when the apostles received the Holy Spirit, it was going to be like when John baptized them?
\tqe In both cases, what the apostles received was a sign that they were beginning a new way of life. (5)
\an (Note: The fact that Jesus used the word "baptize" for both events implies that they are/were similar.)

\bttq What do you know about the name "Israel"?
\tqe Key Term Check: In the New Testament, the terms "Israel" and "Israelite" are used by Jews to refer to themselves, and also by God to refer to them as his people. (See "Israel" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Jesus say to the apostles when they asked this question?
\tqe Jesus did not tell the apostles when the kingdom would be given back to the people of Israel. He said that his Father had set the time at which that would happen. (7)
\bttq How would the apostles be able to continue to act as the representatives of Jesus Christ after he was no longer among them?

\an (Note: See Luke 24:47-48.)
\bttq Jesus had told the apostles that they were to be witnesses for him in many parts of the world. For what reason or reasons could the apostles know that Jesus would not return to earth immediately?
\tqe They were to witness about him in places that were close and also places that were far away. (8)
\bttq What happened immediately after Jesus said that?
\tqe The apostles saw Jesus rise up into the air. Then a cloud covered him and he had completely disappeared. (9)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that the apostles kept looking up into the sky where Jesus was taken up into heaven [by God]?

\bttq Whom did the apostles see next?
\tqe They saw two men dressed in white standing beside them. (10)
\bttq What did the two heavenly messengers say about the return of Jesus to the earth?
\tqe They said that Jesus would return to the earth in the same way that he had gone up into heaven. (11)

\tqe There were about one hundred and twenty believers in that group. (15)
\bttq What did Peter say about the fact that Judas Iscariot had betrayed Jesus?
\tqe He said that a long time previously David had foretold that someone would betray a close companion or friend. David had been guided by the Holy Spirit to write that in the Scriptures. (16)
\bttq To what do you think the writer of this book was referring as "scripture"?
\tqe Key Term Check: The scriptures are the contents of the Old Testament as God gave them to men to write down. (See "scripture" in KBT.)
\bttq What position or work did Judas Iscariot have?
\tqe Peter said that Judas had been one of Jesus' apostles. (17)
\bttq How did Peter describe the death of Judas?
\tqe He said that Judas had bought a field, and in that field he had fallen violently, so that his body had burst open. (18)
\bttq What did the people, who lived in Jerusalem, call the field in which Judas died?
\tqe In the language that they spoke, they called it Akeldama, which means Field of Blood. (19)
\bttq From which part of the Old Testament did Peter quote?
\tqe Peter quoted from one of the Psalms. (20)
\bttq What is the meaning of the first part of the Psalm from which Peter quoted?
\tqe That part of the Psalm means that the house of the person referred to would be deserted. No one would live there any more. (20)
\bttq What is the meaning of the second part of the quotation?
\tqe It means that someone else would do the work that the other person had done. (20)
\bttq How did Peter apply each of these quotations to Judas?
\tqe Since Judas was dead, it was necessary for Peter and the other apostles to choose someone else to be an apostle of Jesus. (21)
\bttq What did Peter say would be required of any believer to be chosen as an apostle to replace Judas? [Your answer should include two points.]
\tqe He must be a man who was a witness of the fact that Jesus had risen from death.
\tqe He must have been a man who kept company with Jesus from the time that John the Baptist was baptizing people until Jesus was taken up [by God] to heaven. (21-22)
\bttq Which of these requirements did Judas Iscariot not meet?
\tqe Because Judas killed himself, he was not a witness of the resurrection of Jesus. Also Judas had not been present when the other apostles saw Jesus going up to heaven. (18,21-22)
\bttq What were the names of the two men who [the believers] nominated as people who might be able to replace Judas Iscariot?
\tqe The two men whose names they suggested were Joseph, also known as Barsabbas or as Justus, and Matthias. (23)
\bttq The believers did two things to find out which of the two men should become an apostle. What two things did they do?
\tqe They prayed that God would show them which man he chose,
\tqe and after that they cast lots. (24,26)
\an (Note: Casting lots was the usual way in that culture to decide certain kinds of questions. When they prayed, they were probably asking God to cause the lot to come out for the man that he would choose to be an apostle.)
\bttq The believers then prayed and said that Judas had abandoned his position as an apostle of Jesus. What else did they say about Judas, and what did that mean?
\tqe They said that Judas had left [his position of being an apostle and died] to go where he belonged. (25)
\bttq Which of the two men who [the believers] had named was chosen to be an apostle?
\tqe The name of Matthias was chosen, so he joined the other eleven apostles. (26)
\an (Note: The method people used at that time to cast lots was to put objects with names on them into a container. Then someone would shake the container until one of the objects fell out of it. The name on that object was considered to show which person was chosen.)

\tqe The believers were all together in one place, apparently in the house where they had been staying. (1-2)
\an (Note: The Jews celebrated the Day of Pentecost fifty days after the Feast of the Passover. Jesus had been crucified during the Feast of the Passover, so it was fifty days since Jesus had been crucified. About ten days after Jesus ascended to heaven, the Feast of Pentecost took place.)

\tqe They had come from all the countries that were known to be inhabited at that time. Probably they had come from most of the parts of the Roman Empire. (5)
\bttq What caused these many visitors from other countries to come to the place where the believers were assembled?
\tqe They heard a loud sound and went quickly to the place where the believers were assembled. (6)
\an (Note: The phrase "this sound [or noise]" refers back to the believers speaking in other tongues.)
\bttq What surprised the crowd of visitors who had come to the place where the believers, who had received the Holy Spirit, had gathered?
\tqe The people in the crowd were bewildered, because they heard those believers speaking in many languages that were not their native languages. (6)

\bttq What did some of the visitors say about the believers who were speaking in different languages?
\tqe Some of the visitors made fun of them/laughed at them and said that the believers were probably drunk/had too much wine. (13)

\bttq What did Peter tell the crowd to show that the believers were not drunk?
\tqe He said it was only nine o'clock in the morning. (15)
\an (Note: He mentioned the time because Jewish people did not drink wine in the morning. Therefore, it was not possible for the believers to be drunk at that time of day.)
\bttq What did Peter say about the prophet Joel?
\tqe Peter said that the prophet Joel had predicted the unusual things that were happening on that day. That is, Joel had said that God would send his Spirit upon many people. (16-17)
\bttq What do you know about prophets?
\tqe Key Term Check: A prophet is someone who speaks for God and is inspired by Him. He often foretells future events. Prophets were mainly spokespersons who called His people to obedience by appealing to Israel's past and future. (See "prophet" in KBT.)

\bttq What kind of things causes people's blood to be shed and many fires to burn?
\tqe In times of war, many people shed their blood.
\tqe Buildings are burned, and sometimes fields of crops are burned causing a lot of smoke.
\tqe Some of these things happen also at the time of natural disasters such as earthquakes.
\tqe When there are revolutions, people may do violent acts, causing destruction. (19b)
\bttq What strange things would happen up in the sky?
\tqe The sun would give much less light than usually, and the moon would appear to be red, so it also would not give much light. (20a)
\bttq When would these "signs" and "wonders" happen?
\tqe These things would happen before the time which Joel called "the day of the Lord." (20b)
\bttq What did Joel mean by "the day of the Lord"?
\tqe "The day of the Lord" means the time when God will judge all people for what they have done while they lived on earth. (20b)
\bttq When would these events about which Joel prophesied take place [in relation to the "day of the Lord"]?
\tqe All of the events that Peter mentioned in what he quoted from the prophet Joel would take place before the "day of the Lord." They would happen before the time when God judges people for what they have done. (20b)
\bttq What statement that Joel made did Peter use as the most important fact that he quoted from this prophecy?
\tqe Joel also said that before the "day of the Lord," everyone who calls on the name of the Lord would be saved by him/the Lord would save everyone who calls upon his name. (21)
\bttq What does it mean to you to have someone as your lord?
\tqe Key Term Check: A lord is someone who has power and exercises it responsibly. To call someone your lord means that you have given him control over your life. The Lord in this case is Jesus. Every Christian strives to make Jesus lord in his or her life by giving Him complete control. (See "Lord" in KBT in the "God" entry.)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to save you?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that a person will rescue someone else out of a dangerous situation. (See "save" in KBT.)
\bttq What parts of the quotation from Joel did Peter say were being fulfilled at the time that he was speaking?
\tqe Peter told the crowd that the believers were speaking in languages they had not learned because the Holy Spirit had come down upon them. They were prophesying, as Joel had foretold. (17-18)

\tqe They could have known that God had sent Jesus as his special personal representative. (22)
\bttq What do you think a miracle is?
\tqe Key Term Check: A miracle is an unusual event that can only be explained as a special action by God. (See "miracle" in KBT.)
\bttq Whom did Peter say had caused Jesus to be killed?
\tqe Peter said that the Jews used the help of godless men to have Jesus killed by nailing him to a cross. (23b)
\bttq What do you know about the cross?
\tqe Key Term Check: The cross was constructed of two pieces of wood. One piece was a thick wooden post, which was placed/planted upright into a hole in the ground. The other piece was the crossbeam, which was fastened across the upright post so that it formed a + or T shape. (See "cross" in KBT.)
\bttq What else did Peter say about the death of Jesus?
\tqe He also said that God had planned in advance that Jesus should be killed by his own people in that way. (23a)
\bttq Which of these two things that Peter said did the Jews already know?
\tqe They knew that they were responsible for having the Roman authorities kill Jesus. (23)

\tqe They did not know that God had known beforehand that God had a purpose in allowing them to kill Jesus. (23)
\bttq In what way did God show that Jesus was much more than a very good man to whom he had given special power?
\tqe After three days, God raised Jesus to life again. (24)
\bttq What final statement did Peter make here about the death of Jesus?
\tqe He said that it was not possible for Jesus to remain dead. (24)

\bttq In the verses which Peter quoted, to whom does the phrase "the Lord" refer?
\tqe In these verses "the Lord" refers to God the Father. (25-28)
\bttq In these verses, whom did David represent as the person who was speaking to "the Lord"?
\tqe David wrote as though a person called the "Holy One" was speaking to God the Father. (25-28)
\bttq To whom does the phrase "your Holy One" refer?
\tqe It is referring to the Messiah. (27)
\an (Note: See Mark 1:24b, John 6:69.)
\bttq In what part of these verses was David clearly not speaking about himself?
\tqe When David said, "because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay," he was not speaking about himself. (27)
\bttq What did Peter mention to prove that David was not speaking about himself as the Lord's "Holy One"?
\tqe Peter said that David had died and his body had been buried [by the people]. Everyone knew that because David's tomb was in Jerusalem. (29)
\bttq How was it possible for David to write something that would be true of the Messiah?
\tqe David was a prophet, and therefore the Holy Spirit enabled him to speak about what would happen to the Messiah. (30)
\an (Note: The Messiah would come into the world many centuries after David had died.)
\bttq What promise had God made to David that Peter referred to in this address?
\tqe God had promised David that one of his descendants would be a king, just as David was. (30)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that it was necessary that God should raise Jesus to life again?
\tqe The Jews believed that if Jesus had remained dead, that would have proved that he was not the Messiah. (31-32a)
\an (Note: Many Jews knew that in certain parts of the Old Testament, God had promised that the Messiah would live forever. Some of the Jews asked Jesus whether this was not true. See John 12:34.)
\bttq When Peter said, "we are all witnesses to this fact," to whom did Peter refer?
\tqe Peter referred at least to himself and the other eleven apostles. Some of the other believers who were included in the 120 mentioned in 1:15 may also have seen Jesus after he had risen from death. (32)
\an (Note: See 1 Corinthians 15:6.)
\bttq After stating that Jesus had truly come alive again and had been seen by many witnesses, Peter said two other things about Christ. What did he say about him?
\tqe Peter said that God the Father had placed Jesus at his right side in heaven. This gave Jesus authority to rule along with his Father. (33)
\bttq Peter included a statement about God the Father and one about the Holy Spirit. What did he say about each of these Persons?
\tqe Peter said that God the Father had promised that he would send the Holy Spirit to those who believed in Jesus.
\tqe The Father gave Jesus the Holy Spirit, authorizing him to send the Holy Spirit down upon the believers. This fulfilled the word about Jesus that John the Baptist had told his followers. (33)
\an (Note: See Luke 3:16.)
\bttq What reason did Peter state for the unusual things that the believers were doing at that time?
\tqe Peter said that the unusual sights and sounds were caused by the Holy Spirit controlling, or "filling," the believers.
\tqe It was the Spirit who sent down what appeared to be tongues of fire that rested upon the believers' heads. It was also the Spirit who caused them to speak clearly and understandably in languages they had never learned. (33b)
\bttq What did Peter say about David in the Psalm from which he quoted?
\tqe Peter pointed out that David could not have been speaking about himself, because David had not ascended into heaven. (34b-35)
\bttq In the verses that Peter quoted from the Psalm, whom did David say spoke, and to whom did that person speak?
\tqe David wrote that a person whom he described as "The Lord" spoke to another person, whom David described as "my Lord." When David said "The Lord," he meant God the Father. When David said "my Lord" he meant a different person who was also David's superior in authority. The person whom David described as his Lord was the Messiah. Therefore, these verses tell what God the Father said to the Messiah. (34b-35)
\bttq What did God the Father say to the one whom David described as "my Lord"?

\bttq What do you think the writer of Acts meant when he wrote that "much grace was upon them all"?

\bttq How did believers who had many possessions share with those who were in need?

\bttq What do you think is the reason that the author of Acts gave details about how the church took care of widows among the believers who had needs?
\an Luke made it clear that the church took care of the widows who had no one to provide for them. The apostles were doing this work of caring for the widows.

\bttq What do you think is the reason that they opposed the teaching of Stephen?
\an (Note: They argued with him because they did not believe the message about Jesus that he preached. They may have been angry because a large number of Jewish priests had joined the people who believed that Jesus was the Christ.) (9)
\bttq What is the reason that the men from the "Synagogue of the Freedmen" were not able to win out over Stephen/prove that Stephen was wrong when they argued with him?

\an (Note: In giving a summary of the history of the Israelites, Stephen showed that he believed in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and respected the Law of Moses. He pointed out that the religious rulers of his time had rejected what God was offering them, just as their ancestors had.)

\bttq How do you think it happened that there was grain in Egypt, even during the years of famine?
\an (Note: Because God had given Joseph unusual wisdom, Joseph had caused the people of Egypt to store up their extra grain during years when there were good crops. So when the famine years came, there was grain in Egypt.)
\bttq How many times did Joseph's brother go to Egypt to buy grain?
\tqe Joseph's brothers went to Egypt twice and bought grain. Then they took the grain back to Canaan. (13)

\tqref ACT 7.20-53
\bttq What do you think is the reason that the parents of Moses cared for him inside their home for only three months?
\an (Note: After Moses was more than three months old, it was impossible for his parents to hide the fact that they had a baby in their home. Someone who served Pharaoh would have told Pharaoh that a Hebrew couple were hiding a baby boy, and Moses would have been taken away from them and killed.) (20)

\tqe and he was a strong, energetic man who could express himself well. (22)
\bttq Although Moses was brought up in the household of the king of Egypt, he knew that he was an Israelite. How do you think he knew that?
\an (Note: When Moses was still small enough to need a lot of personal care, his mother cared for him. When he grew into a boy and then into a man, no doubt his parents continued to visit him and talk with him, and to have him visit them. So he knew he was an Israelite, even though he had been taught and trained like an Egyptian child.) (23)
\bttq What did Moses do one day when he was forty years old?
\tqe One day when Moses was forty years old, he went to where the Israelites [were working as slaves. He wanted to see what was happening]. (23)

\tqe He saw an Egyptian hurting an Israelite, [probably a man who was working for him]. So he hit the Egyptian with such force that he killed him. (24)
\bttq What was the reason that Moses was not afraid to punish the Egyptian whom he saw mistreating an Israelite?
\tqe Moses thought that the Israelites would understand that God had sent him to set them free [from the Egyptians]. (25)
\bttq Those Israelites saw Moses kill the Egyptian. How did they feel about what he had done?
\an (Note: The Israelites did not understand that Moses was trying to help them. They were afraid of him because he had suddenly killed one of the people for whom they were working.) (27-28)
\bttq What happened that made Moses suddenly leave Egypt and go to Midian?
\tqe The day after Moses had killed the Egyptian, he tried to separate two Israelites who were fighting. One of them said to him, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you going to kill me, the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday?" (27-28)
\bttq What did Moses do in Midian?
\tqe Moses settled as a foreigner in Midian,

\bttq When Moses went close to the bush to see why it was not being burned up, what happened?
\tqe When Moses went close to the bush, God spoke to him through the angel that was in the bush. (31)

\tqe He said that Elymas repeatedly persuaded people that the truths of the word of God were lies. (9-10)
\bttq What did Paul tell Elymas was going to happen to him because he opposed Barnabas and Paul?
\tqe Paul told Elymas that the Lord was going to make him completely blind for a while.
\tqe God would punish him in this way for opposing the message that Barnabas and Paul preached. (11)
\bttq What happened to Elymas after Paul said this?

\tqe The governor believed that the message that Paul preached [about the Lord Jesus] was true when he saw that Elymas became blind, just as Paul had told him he would. (12)

\bttq What do you think the Sabbath means?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Sabbath is the name of the seventh and last day of the week. It was set aside by the Jews as a strict day of rest from the normal work that was done on the six other days of the week. The Jews continue to observe the Sabbath on Saturday. (See "Sabbath" in KBT.)

\tqe They prophesied that [the Messiah's] own people would condemn him [and that people would kill him]. (27)
\bttq What do you think it means if/that someone condemns someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that someone pronounces someone else guilty with the clear implication that the person will be punished for what he did. (See "condemn" in KBT in the "judge, judgment" entry.)
\bttq What was the reason that the people of Jerusalem and their rulers demanded that Jesus be killed [by people], even though they had heard those prophecies about the Messiah many times?
\tqe They demanded that Jesus be killed, because they did not recognize that Jesus [was the Messiah about whom the prophets had written]. (27)
\bttq What else did Paul say about the rulers of the Jews?
\tqe He said that when they demanded that Jesus [should be killed by people], they did what the prophets had written [people would do to the Messiah]. (27)
\bttq What other event in the life of Jesus fulfilled a promise that God had made to the people of Israel?
\tqe God fulfilled a promise he had made to the people of Israel when he raised Jesus from the dead [three days after Jesus was crucified by people]. (32-33)

\tqe He/that person would bring many blessings to God's people. (34)
\an (Note: See 13:23 for the promise that God made with David.)
\bttq In what way did Jesus fulfill the promise that God would give his people "the holy and sure blessings promised to David"?

\an (Note: See John 12:34.)
\bttq For what reason did Paul remind the people in the synagogue that after David had died and
\bttq [people] had buried his body, his body had decayed?
\tqe Paul wanted the people in the synagogue to recognize that David was not speaking about himself when he wrote: "You will not let your Holy One undergo decay." (35-37)
\bttq What was the most important fact that Paul told the people in the synagogue about Jesus?
\tqe He told them that [God] would forgive them for their sins and count them as justified/ righteous if they would believe [in Jesus as their Savior]. (38-39)
\bttq What did Paul tell the people in the synagogue that obeying the law of Moses could not do for them?
\tqe He told them that [God] would not count them as righteous even if they had obeyed the law of Moses. (39)

\bttq What did Paul and Barnabas mean when they told the people who wanted to hear [about the Lord Jesus again] that they should "continue in the grace of God"?
\tqe Paul and Barnabas told them to continue to believe that it was only through trusting in Jesus/the Savior, whom God had sent, that [God] would forgive their sins. (43)
\bttq What happened when Paul and Barnabas returned [to the synagogue] on the next Sabbath?
\tqe Almost all the people in the city, both Jews and Gentiles, gathered to hear [Paul preach again] about Jesus Christ.
\tqe But, when the [leaders of the] Jews, [who had rejected that message], saw how many people had gathered to hear Paul and Barnabas, they were jealous.
\tqe So they opposed Paul and said abusive things about his message/what he was saying. (44-45)
\bttq How did Paul and Barnabas reply to the Jews who spoke against them and tried to keep people from believing the message about the Lord Jesus?
\tqe They told those Jews that it had been necessary to tell them the message from God [about Jesus] before they told it to the Gentiles. Because those Jews had rejected the message from God [about Jesus/the Savior who God had sent to them] now Paul and Barnabas would preach to the Gentiles. (46-47)

\tqe He said they would preach to the Gentiles because the Lord had commanded them to do it. (47a)

\tqe Paul applied this word from the writings of Isaiah to himself. (47a)
\bttq What do you think the figure of speech "a light for the Gentiles" means?

\bttq How did the Gentiles who had heard Paul's sermon respond to it?
\tqe Many Gentiles/non-Jews were happy to hear the message about the Lord Jesus.

\tqe [Many more people believed in the Lord Jesus.] (49)

\tqe [Leaders of] the Jews [who had opposed the message of Paul and Barnabas] incited some of the men and women who had power in the city to join them in persecuting Paul and Barnabas.
\tqe So Paul and Barnabas had to leave that region. (50)
\bttq What was the reason that Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet when they left Antioch?
\tqe Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet [to show those Jews that God had rejected them and would punish them]. (51)

\oh Overview
\tqref ACT 15.1-21
\bttq For what reason did Christians in Antioch think that God required them to be circumcised? What did they do about this important question?
\tqe Certain Jewish believers from Jerusalem had gone to Antioch and told the Gentile believers there that unless they were circumcised, God would not save them.
\tqe So/therefore, the people in Antioch chose a delegation to go to Jerusalem and ask the leaders of that church what they needed to do.
\dh Details
\bttq Who were the visitors who arrived in Antioch? What did they tell the Gentile Christians there?
\tqe Some Jewish Christians came from Judea and told the Gentile Christians that they needed to be circumcised in order for God to save them. (1)

\bttq In Jerusalem, some of the Jewish Christians told the group of believers who had come from Antioch that Gentile believers needed to be circumcised and keep the rest of the Law of Moses. If they did not keep the Law of Moses, God would not forgive their sins and accept them. For what reason did they think that was true?
\tqe The believers who told Paul and Barnabas that still belonged to the group of Pharisees, and they were very careful to obey the Law of Moses. (5)
\bttq Did the apostles and elders in Jerusalem think what those men said was true? What did they do to settle the question?
\tqe The apostles and elders had a meeting in which they discussed the question: "What does God require of Gentiles who become believers in the Lord Jesus?" (6)
\bttq What did the apostle Peter say to answer this question?
\tqe Peter told that when he had preached to the Gentiles about the Lord Jesus, they had believed.
\tqe He said that while he was preaching, those Gentiles had received the Holy Spirit.
\tqe This showed that God had accepted them just as they were. (7-8)
\bttq What does someone do when he believes?
\tqe Key Term Check: He puts his trust and commitment in another person. (See "believe" in KBT.)
\bttq When God gave those Gentiles the Holy Spirit, what else did that show/indicate?
\tqe When God gave the Gentiles the Holy Spirit as soon as they believed, that showed/indicated that he had forgiven their sins and accepted them as belonging to him. (9)
\bttq The Jewish Christians who were still Pharisees had said that Gentile Christians had to keep the Law of Moses in order for God to save them. To what did Peter compare that?
\tqe Peter said that requiring Gentile believers to keep the Law of Moses would be like asking them to do what even the Jews had never been able to do. (10)
\bttq According to what Peter said, how does God save Jewish people?
\tqe God saves Jews in the same way that he saves Gentiles.

\bttq What did the apostle James say about the Gentiles?
\tqe The apostle James said that long ago the Old Testament prophets had written that, in the future, a time would come when God would call Gentiles to seek after him and put their trust in him.
\tqe What Peter had just told about the conversion of Gentiles fulfilled that prophecy. (13-18)
\bttq What advice did James give concerning the Gentiles who were turning to the true God?
\tqe James advised that the Gentiles who were now worshipping God should not be required to keep all of the Law of Moses.
\tqe There were just four things/practices [which Moses had] written in the Law that he believed the Gentiles should no longer do when they became Christians. (19-20)
\bttq What were these four things/practices?
\tqe Gentiles who became Christians were to be advised not to eat food that had been offered to idols.
\tqe They were not to have a sexual relationship with any person except the one/husband or wife to whom they were married.
\tqe They were not to eat the meat of any animal that had been killed without draining its blood.
\tqe They were not to eat or drink the animal's blood. (20)
\bttq What is the reason that James said that Gentiles who became Christians should avoid those four practices?

\dh Details
\bttq Who were the people with whom Paul spoke in the marketplace? What did they think about what Paul was trying to teach?
\tqe Certain of the people whom Paul met in the marketplace were teachers whom people called "philosophers."
\tqe They thought that Paul had some strange beliefs, and they did not think that what Paul said was important.
\tqe Other philosophers who talked with Paul decided that he must be trying to teach them about gods whom people in some other place worshipped. (18)
\bttq For what reason did certain men invite Paul to go with them to the place where the important men of Athens met?

\tqe The saying which Paul quoted was written by a Greek poet whom all the people listening respected.

\bttq What did Paul next tell the people about the true God?
\tqe Paul told them that we ought not to think that [the true] God is anything like the images of gold, silver, or stone which people worship.

\bttq When God judges the people of the world, for what sin/offense will he judge them?
\tqe Paul implied that it is wrong/sin for people to worship idols.
\tqe In past times, people had worshipped idols because they did not know God.
\tqe Because they did not know him/God, he/God had not punished them.
\tqe But now, God was commanding people everywhere to repent and stop doing evil.
\tqe On a certain day, God was going to judge all people for the evil things that they have done. (29-31)
\bttq What do you think it means for a person to judge someone?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means someone/a judge will determine if a person is guilty or not of committing a crime. He does this by assessing the evidence connected to the person and what he may have done. (See "judge" in KBT.)
\bttq Paul then said that in past times, God had not punished people for the evil things that they did. What kind of wrong/sin did Paul mention?
\tqe People had worshipped idols/other gods when they did not know who the true God was/is.

\bttq For what reason did Paul say that God now was commanding all people everywhere to repent? Of what should people repent?
\tqe Paul said that now people could now know who the true God is/was, they should turn away from their evil ways.
\tqe [Paul implied that when people know who God is, they should no longer worship false gods.
\tqe They should worship only him.] (30b)
\bttq What reason did Paul give for people to repent and worship only (the true) God?
\tqe Paul said that God had already appointed a man who was one day going to judge all people, and he would judge them justly/fairly.
\tqe God had shown which man he had chosen to be the judge by raising him to life again after he had been killed. (31)
\bttq How did the people who were at the meeting respond to the message about Jesus?
\tqe Some of them made fun of Paul when he said that a man had come alive again after he died.
\tqe Others said that they wanted to hear Paul speak to them again about that.
\tqe A few of the people believed. Among those who believed was a man named Dionysius, who was a member of the council. Also a woman named Damaris was among those who believed. (32-34)

\bttq What else did the sailors do while they waited for the day to dawn?

\tqe Key Term Check: The word "gospel" is a translation of the Greek noun euangelion. In the New Testament the noun euangelion is used in a restricted sense. It does not mean just any kind of good news, but specifically the good news, or joyful report, that God has made a way of salvation for sinful human beings. In the New Testament it is always used with this one sense and is usually translated in the RSV, and most modern English versions, as "gospel". (See "gospel" in KBT.)

\oh Overview
\tqref EPH 2.11-22
\bttq Tell in your own words the basic meaning (theme) of what Paul wrote in these verses.
\tqe The Gentile people had previously not known God. As far as the Jews were concerned, the Gentiles were outcasts [from God]. Now Christ has united both the Gentiles and the Jews as one people. God has been kind to both groups (of people). Because they believed Christ they are now God's people.
\dh Details
\bttq What did Paul tell the Gentiles to remember?
\tqe He told them to remember that, in the past, they were called "the uncircumcised" [by the Jews]. (11)
\an (Note: That was the Jews' way of showing contempt for the Gentiles because the Jews considered themselves to be the people of God because they had been circumcised.)
\bttq What is the reason Paul said that circumcision refers only to the body?
\tqe He said that because it is only an outward, physical sign. (11)
\bttq Who do you think the Gentiles are?

\bttq What do you think it means to circumcise someone?

\bttq What was the condition of the Gentiles in the past, before they believed in Christ?

\bttq Whom do you think Paul meant by "citizenship in Israel"?
\tqe Key Term Check: After the resurrection of Jesus Christ, Christians regarded themselves as being the true people of God because of their belief in Jesus Christ. They, therefore, referred to themselves as "Israel" and regarded themselves as the spiritual successors of the people of Israel. In this sense the focus is on being the people of God; racial origin is not important. (See "Israel" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think it means to hope in something?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means to have a desire to see something happen or to obtain something.
\bttq What did Jesus Christ do so that they might not be separated from God any longer?
\tqe Jesus Christ shed his blood and died for them,
\tqe and through union with him, they are now related to God. (13)

\bttq To whom did he preach that message of peace?
\tqe He preached that message to the Gentiles and to the Jews. (17)
\bttq What do you think someone is doing when they preach?
\tqe Key Term Check: When someone preaches, they are proclaiming the gospel to those who are listening. This also means a person urges others to accept or abandon an idea or course of action.
\bttq Who is able to come into the presence of God, the Father, now?
\tqe All of us, both Jews and Gentiles can come into the presence of God. (18)
\bttq What is the reason that we are able to do this?

\tqe He took/brought her to the man. (22)
\tqref GEN 2.23-25

\bttq As the woman looked at the fruit, what did she think about it?
\tqe She thought that it looked very good, and that it was probably delicious, and that it would make her wise. (6)
\bttq So what did the woman do?

\bttq What else did the woman do?
\tqe She gave some of that fruit to her husband, and he ate it/them, too. (6)

\tqe Key Term Check: In pronouncing punishment here, God had cursed the serpent. In this context, "curse" is the opposite of "bless." (See "bless" in KBT.)
\bttq In the future, what will the serpent do to the woman's offspring/descendent(s)?

\bttq What new/different experience did God say that the woman would have from that time on?
\tqe God said that the woman would have/experience great pain when she gives birth to a child. He also said that she would desire her husband/that she would desire to rule over her husband, but that her husband would rule over her. (16)

\bttq What name did Adam give to his wife?
\tqe He called her "Eve." (20)
\bttq For what reason did he choose that name for her?
\tqe That name means "life," and she would be the mother/ancestor of everyone born after that. (20)
\bttq What did God do for Adam and his wife at that time?
\tqe He made them clothing from the skins of animals. (21)
\tqref GEN 3.22-24
\bttq What do you think would be the situation of mankind, if people had been allowed/permitted to continue to eat fruit from the tree that gave/gives life?
\tqe People might have lived forever (in the state of knowing good and evil). (22)
\bttq At first, Adam and Eve were allowed to eat fruit from the tree that gives life, and they would not die. Why do you think it was no longer good for mankind to live forever?
\tqe It was no longer good because we/they are now spiritually dead. We/they have experienced both good and evil. (22)
\bttq Therefore, what did God do so that people were no longer able to eat fruit from the tree that gave/gives life?

\bttq Whom did God expel/send away from the Garden of Eden?
\tqe He sent out both Adam and Eve. -OR- He sent out Adam, and his wife accompanied him. (23)

\tqe He was to work/cultivate the soil. (23)
\bttq The cherubim/watchers which God placed at the gate - what do you think they were like?
\an (Note: We do not know about their appearance. They were probably strong and powerful. Nobody could persuade the cherubim/watchers to allow them to return to the Garden.)
\tqe Key Term Check: The beings whom God placed to guard the gate to Eden were called "cherubim", the plural form of "cherub". A cherub is a supernatural being. It might belong to a subclass of angelic beings, or it might be something similar to an angel. (See "angel" in KBT.)
\bttq What was the reason that God placed the cherubim at the gate?
\tqe God placed the cherubim there to keep anyone from entering the Garden (and thus being able to eat fruit from the tree that gave/gives life). (24)
\bttq What do you think about that serpent which tempted Eve and Adam - do you think that it was just a snake?
\tqe No, it was really Satan (who is the leader of evil spirits).

\bttq After a time, Cain did something with some of the produce from his farm. Abel likewise did something with some of his lambs. What did the brothers do?
\tqe They gave some of the increase from their work as a gift to God. (3-4)
\tqe Key Term Check: This is the first of many occasions in Scripture where someone brings an offering to God. In some languages, it may be necessary to use a different term for Cain's offering of farm produce from that used for Abel's offering of an animal. (See "sacrifice, offering" in KBT.)

\bttq Then how did Cain feel?
\tqe Cain felt angry/upset/depressed. (5)
\bttq So what did God say to Cain?
\tqe God assured Cain that he/God would accept him, if he (Cain) responded in the proper way. God also warned Cain that he (Cain) must be careful, because the desire to rebel against God is like an enemy/a wild animal who wanted/wants to destroy him, and that Cain must seek to overcome that desire. (6-7)
\bttq What do you understand is meant by "sin"? // What do you understand "sin" to be?
\tqe Key Term Check: In this context, Cain has refused to accept God's judgment as just. The central idea of "sin" is rebellion against God. (See "sin" in KBT.)

\bttq So then what did Cain do?
\tqe He suggested that Abel go with him to an uninhabited/secluded place. Then he attacked and killed Abel. (8)

\bttq What was God's answer to Cain?
\tqe God/He said that, no, people would not kill him. God/He said that, if someone did kill Cain/him, then God would punish the killer seven times more/harder than he had punished Cain. -OR- God said, "No, people will not kill you. If someone does (try to) kill you, I will punish that killer/him seven times harder than I have punished you." (15)
\bttq And then what else did God do to protect Cain?
\tqe God/He put a mark/sign on Cain to warn anyone who might try to kill him/Cain. (15)

\tqref GEN 4.23-26
\bttq What did Lamech say about anyone who might try to harm him?
\tqe He said that such a person would be punished 77 times. (24)
\bttq What was the name of the third son of Adam and Eve? For what reason was he named that?
\tqe He was named "Seth," because that means "give/gift/substitute"; and Eve said that God had given Seth to replace Abel. (25)
\bttq What did people begin to do during the time of Seth?
\tqe They began to worship God. -OR- They began to call God by his name, "Yahweh". (26)
\tqe Key Term Check: There are two well-supported interpretations of this passage. One interpretation is that at this time, people began to use the name, YHWH, in calling upon God. Another possible meaning is that, at this time, people began once again to turn to God - to call upon him/call out to him and worship him. (See "name" in KBT.)

\an (Note: If the translation uses a word something like "remember" here, be sure/ensure that the reader/person who answers does not think that this implies that God had forgotten about everyone on the large boat, and then he suddenly remembered them.)
\bttq As the waters began to recede/go down, where did the large boat finally come to rest?

\bttq What did the dove do after Noah released it the first time?
\tqe It flew around, and then returned to the boat (because the water was still too high). (9)
\bttq What did the dove do after Noah released it the second time?

\tqe We learn that he was king of Salem, and also a priest of God Most High. (18)
\bttq What do you think was the work of a priest?
\tqe Key Term Check: During the time of the Old Testament, people understood that they could not simply approach God on their own. A priest was a "go-between" or mediator between people and God. A priest would offer sacrifices to God on behalf of God's people. A priest would also burn incense, offer prayers, and lead the people in worshipping God. (See "priest" in KBT.)
\bttq We learn that Melchizedek brought Abram food and drink/bread and wine. What else did Melchizedek do for Abram?
\tqe Melchizedek also blessed Abram/asked God to do good for Abram. (19)
\tqe Key Term Check: On several previous occasions, God has blessed people or animals (Genesis 1:22, 28; 5:2; 9:1; 12:2-3). In this passage/section the author wrote that Melchizedek blessed Abram. It was not that Melchizedek did the same thing that God had done - rather, in this passage Melchizedek asked God to do good for/bless Abram. (See "bless" in KBT.)

\bttq What was the reason that Abram gave for not wanting to receive anything from the king of Sodom?
\tqe Abram said that if he did receive something from the king of Sodom, then the king could say that he was the one who made Abram wealthy. (23)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Abram did not want the king of Sodom to be able to say that he was the one who made Abram wealthy?
\tqe Perhaps it was because the people Sodom were especially evil. (13:10,13) Or perhaps Abram simply did not want any person to claim that they were the ones who made Abram wealthy - that it was God who had made Abram wealthy.
\bttq What was Abram willing to accept from the king of Sodom?
\tqe Abram was willing to accept the food that his men had already eaten, and also the share of the booty/goods to which his allies were entitled. (24)

\tqe She blamed Abram. // She said that Abram was at fault.
\tqe Key Term Check: Sarai said in this account/passage that God should examine her and Abram, and that God should decide/pass judgment concerning who was at fault.

\oh Overview
\tqref GEN 19.1-29
\bttq Tell what happened at this time.
\tqe The two angels went to Sodom, and Lot persuaded them to stay overnight at his house. The men of Sodom tried to take the two visitors and rape them. In order to protect themselves and Lot's family, the angels struck the rioting men blind/with blindness/caused the rioting men to become blind. The next morning, the two visitors/visiting angels grabbed Lot and his wife and two daughters and led them out of the city. Sodom and Gomorrah - and the whole plain - were destroyed.
\dh Details
\tqref GEN 19.1-2

\tqe The men and boys of Sodom came, surrounded the house, and told Lot to send out his two visitors. (4-5)
\bttq What did the men of Sodom want to do with Lot's two visitors?
\tqe They wanted to rape/violate the visitors. (5)
\bttq Instead of Lot sending out/giving his two visitors to the men of Sodom, what did he suggest to the crowd?
\tqe Lot said that he would give to the crowd his two maiden daughters instead. (8)
\bttq What do you think was the reason why Lot offered his two daughters to the crowd, instead of sending out/giving up his visitors?
\tqe It would seem that, in Lot's mind, it was worse for his visitors to be raped/violated than for the same to happen to his daughters.
\tqref GEN 19.9-14
\bttq After Lot begged the crowd not to harm his guests, what was the crowd's response?
\tqe The crowd ordered Lot to stand aside/get out of the way, and they threatened to treat him worse than they would treat the visitors. They crowded in on Lot, nearly pushing the door down. (9)
\bttq Then what did Lot's two visitors do?
\tqe They pulled Lot inside the house and locked the door. Then they made the men blind/temporarily blind. (10-11)
\bttq What did Lot's two visitors instruct him to do?
\tqe They told Lot to warn his relatives to flee. Lot was to warn his children and anyone married to his children. (12)
\bttq What was the reason that the angels would have to destroy Sodom?
\tqe They would have to destroy Sodom because God was aware that the people of Sodom were very/excessively evil. (13)
\bttq To whom did Lot go to warn that Sodom was about to be destroyed?
\tqe Lot went to warn two men who were about/planning to marry his daughters. (14)

\tqe The angels took them by their hands and led/took them out of the city. (17)
\bttq God was willing to save Lot, even though Lot was not willing to leave. What does this show us about God's character? // What can we see in this incident about God's character?
\tqe God is merciful. (16)
\tqe Key Term Check: God was not obligated to save Lot and his family (from destruction), especially since Lot was not willing to obey the angels and leave Sodom. But God showed mercy or compassion in removing Lot and thus saving him. (See "mercy" in KBT.)
\bttq What did the angels instruct Lot and his family?

\bttq What did Lot admit that the angels were doing for him?
\tqe Lot admitted that the angels were (being) kind/merciful to save him. (19)
\tqe Key Term Check: In this situation, Lot was probably not referring to being saved from eternal punishment, but rather he meant that the angels were delivering him from certain death, as Sodom was about to be destroyed. Some languages may use one term to refer to saving someone from death, and a different term to refer to saving someone from eternal punishment. (See "save" in KBT.)
\bttq So what did Lot suggest that he and his family do, instead of fleeing all the way to the mountains?
\tqe Lot suggested that he and his family take shelter in a small nearby town/city. (20)
\bttq What was the angel's response to Lot's suggestion/request?
\tqe The angel agreed. He allowed Lot and his family to stay at a small place. (21)
\bttq What did the angel urge Lot and his family to do?
\tqe He urged them to hurry. (22)
\bttq What did the angel say was the reason why Lot and his family must hurry?
\tqe Lot and his family must hurry because the angel was soon to begin to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. But the angel could not begin (to destroy the cities/the wicked people of the cities) until Lot and his family were safe. (22)
\bttq After that/From then on, what did people call that place where Lot and his family took shelter?

\bttq While Lot and his family were fleeing, what did Lot's wife do?
\tqe She looked back at Sodom. (26)
\bttq When Lot's wife looked back, what happened to her?
\tqe She became like a statue made of salt. (26)
\tqref GEN 19.27-29
\bttq Who now went and looked out over the land?
\tqe Abraham looked out over the land. (27-28)
\bttq What (kinship) relationship was Abraham to Lot?
\tqe Abraham was Lot's uncle.
\bttq What did Abraham see?
\tqe Abraham saw thick smoke above the land, like a huge cooking/smoking fire/like smoke from a furnace. (28)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that God showed mercy to Lot?
\tqe Lot was Abraham's nephew, and Abraham had been asking God not to destroy Sodom if there were good/innocent people living there. (It is not clear whether/that Lot, his wife, and their two daughters were "righteous/innocent" people. But probably they were, at least, not as evil as the rest of the people who were destroyed.)

\bttq What did Abimelech claim here about his character?
\tqe He said that he was innocent: that he had done no wrong/that his conscience was clear and his hands were "clean". (5)
\tqe Key Term Check: A person with "clean hands" is one who is not guilty. (Either they did not commit an offense, or else they did but then they repented and the offended person(s)/one(s) forgave them.) (See "clean" in KBT.)

Ishmael nearly died of thirst, but suddenly Hagar heard a voice promising that Ishmael would live and that his descendents would become a great nation. Then God showed Hagar some water, and Ishmael's life was spared. He grew up in the wilderness, became an archer, and eventually married/took a woman from Egypt for his wife.

\bttq From where did the voice come?
\tqe The voice came from heaven/the sky.
\tqe Key Term Check: It is not clear here whether the author intended to say that the voice came from the "sky", that is, from somewhere above; or if the voice came from "heaven" (where God is said to dwell). If the translators understand this to be referring to "heaven, where God is said to dwell"; then it is possible that a different term will be used in the translation/here than in earlier passages referring to the "sky" (e.g., Gen. 1; 2; 7:11; 8:2). (See "heaven, sky" in KBT.)
\bttq What did God/the angel of God say to Hagar?

\bttq Tell what happened in this passage between the twins.
\tqe Esau became a skillful hunter, while Jacob preferred to stay home. One day Esau came in from hunting. He was tired and hungry. Jacob was cooking some stew, so Esau asked for some of it. Jacob told Esau that he could have some, but only if Esau swore/promised to give up his rights as the firstborn son to Jacob. So Esau agreed to do that, and he did not seem to regret his action.
\bttq What do you think about the way the two young men behaved in this incident?
\tqe Probably it was not appropriate for Jacob to manipulate his brother in this way. And it was quite certainly not appropriate for Esau to care so little about his birthright.

\bttq So what did Jacob say in response to Esau's request?
\tqe Jacob said that he would give Esau some food, but only if Esau would give Jacob his (Esau's) birthright - that is, Esau's rights as first-born son. (31)
\bttq In your opinion, what do you think Esau was entitled to as the firstborn son?
\tqe At that time, it meant that Esau would inherit twice as much as his younger brother, Jacob.
\bttq So what did Esau answer to Jacob's request for the birthright?

\bttq Those two both had a (similar) meaning. What did the dreams mean?
\tqe They meant that Joseph's parents and his brothers would show/give special honor to Joseph. (7,9)
\bttq What do you think caused Joseph's brothers to become angry, when he told them his dreams?
\tqe The dreams showed Joseph like/as a king ruling over his older brothers. They already disliked him, because he was Jacob's favorite son. They certainly did not want to bow down to him. (8,10-11)
\bttq In a family with many brothers, who do you think is usually the leader?
\tqe Probably the eldest brother is usually the leader.
\bttq After Joseph's brothers were so angry about his first dream, why do you think Joseph told them about his second dream?
\tqe Maybe Joseph was proud, and he wanted to taunt/mock his older brothers. Or maybe he felt that God had given him the dreams and therefore it was wrong not to tell about them.
\bttq What was meant by the "sun, moon and eleven stars"?
\tqe The sun was his father, the moon was his mother, and the eleven stars were his half-brothers. (10)
\bttq For what reason do you think Jacob scolded Joseph when Joseph recounted/told his family about his dreams?
\tqe Perhaps Jacob recognized that Joseph was proud in claiming/seeming to claim that he (Joseph) would become a leader over the rest of his family. (10)
\bttq In your opinion, what do you think caused Joseph's brothers to become very jealous of him?
\tqe Perhaps they believed that God spoke through dreams, and that Joseph might actually become a leader over them - and they would not have liked that. (11)
\bttq How did Jacob react to Joseph's dreams?
\tqe Jacob thought about what they might mean. (11)

\bttq What did Joseph tell him was the meaning of that dream?
\tqe He said that the three baskets represented three days, after which Pharaoh/someone would take the baker from prison and cut off his (the baker's) head. And Pharaoh would have someone impale the baker on a post. Then birds would come and peck at the corpse of the baker. (18-19)

\bttq Tell me about Pharaoh's first dream.
\tqe In his dream, he was standing near the Nile River. There he saw seven fat and healthy cows come from the river. And then seven different cows appeared - but they were all very thin and ugly. (At first) they stood near the fat cows. Then (suddenly) the thin cows ate the fat cows. (2-4)

\tqref GEN 41.9-13
\bttq What did Pharaoh's chief drink-server/cup-bearer do at that time?
\tqe He remembered Joseph and told Pharaoh about him. (9-13)
\bttq When the drink-server/cup-bearer said that he remembered his sins/failure/wrong, to what do you think he was referring?
\tqe He might have been referring to what he had done which resulted in Pharaoh putting him in prison. Or he might have been thinking of Joseph's request to tell Pharaoh about him (Joseph). Or he might have been thinking about both of those events. (9)
\bttq Tell me about what the drink-server/cup-bearer said to Pharaoh at this time.
\tqe He said that Pharaoh had put him in prison, along with the chief baker. And that one night, each of them had had a dream. A young Hebrew man who was in prison with them was able to tell them the meaning of their dreams. And everything had happened exactly as the young Hebrew man had said they would. (10-13)

\tqe He said that he was not able to interpret dreams himself, but that God could reveal the meaning. (16)
\bttq What does this suggest about Joseph's character?
\tqe It shows that he trusted (in) God, and that he was humble. He did not want anyone to think that he (Joseph) had powers or abilities which he did not truly have in himself.
\bttq What did Pharaoh say about the thin cows when he first saw them in his dream?
\tqe He said that they were thin and very ugly - that he had never seen such ugly cows in all of Egypt. (19)
\bttq And after the thin cows had eaten the fat ones, how did they appear?
\tqe They were still thin and ugly - as though they had not eaten anything. (21)
\tqref GEN 41.25-32
\bttq According to Joseph, what was the purpose of Pharaoh's two dreams?
\tqe God was showing (to) Pharaoh what he (God) would do. (25)
\bttq What was the meaning of the seven fat cows and seven plump heads of grain in the dreams?
\tqe They represented seven years of abundance/prosperity, with very good crops. (26)
\bttq What was the meaning of the seven thin cows and the seven thin/empty heads of grain?
\tqe They represented seven years of famine. (27)
\bttq Since Pharaoh had two dreams, did that mean that there would be two times of abundance, and that there would also be two times of famine?
\tqe No, both of the dreams referred to (the) one time of abundance followed by (the) one seven-year famine. (25-26)
\bttq What did Joseph say about how serious the famine would be?
\tqe He said that the famine would be so severe that people would forget about the seven years of abundance. (30-31)
\bttq (Then) what is the significance of Pharaoh having two dreams (rather than only one dream)?
\tqe God was showing that it would truly happen and that it would be soon. (32)
\bttq Was God revealing things about which he (God) knew, but over which he had no control? Or did God have control over those times of abundance and times of famine?
\tqe God not only knew about what would happen, but he also had control over all the events/happenings. (25,28,32)
\bttq Do you remember when Joseph dreamt while he was a boy in Canaan? Can you see anything similar between Joseph's experience then and Pharaoh's experience at this time?
\tqe With Joseph and (also) with Pharaoh, there were two dreams, and both times the two dreams had the same meaning.
\tqref GEN 41.33-36
\bttq What did Joseph advise Pharaoh?
\tqe He advised Pharaoh to choose a wise/discerning man to administer many others who would gather grain during the good years and store it to be used during the time of famine. (33-35)
\bttq How much grain did Pharaoh's officials need to gather during the years of abundance?

\tqe The people would starve. They would die from lack of food. (36)
\bttq In your opinion, by what means do you think that Joseph had become knowledgeable about planning or preparing?

\bttq What did Pharaoh mean when he said that no one would move a hand or a foot in the entire land of Egypt without Joseph's approval? Does this mean (literally) that every person must request permission from Joseph to even move a hand or foot?
\tqe No, it is an expression that emphasized that Pharaoh had given to Joseph power or authority above everyone else in Egypt (except for Pharaoh). (44)
\bttq What else did Pharaoh change in Joseph's life?
\tqe He gave him an Egyptian name, and he arranged his marriage. (45)
\bttq Who became Joseph's wife?

\bttq How old was Joseph when Pharaoh made him the chief ruler (under Pharaoh) in Egypt?
\tqe Joseph was 30 years old. (46)
\bttq For a long period of time, Joseph was a slave or in jail. How many years had passed since his brothers had sold him to the traders?
\tqe It had been 13 years. (Joseph was 17 years old (Genesis 37:2), when Jacob had sent him to check on his older brothers.)
\bttq From this story about Joseph, what lessons can we see about why God sometimes causes people to experience difficulty?
\tqe God uses suffering to test us and to change us. He is always in control of the circumstances that affect us, even though sometimes it may not appear as though God is in control.
\bttq As soon as Joseph left Pharaoh's palace, what did he do?
\tqe He traveled throughout the land of Egypt (probably in order to become familiar with the country and its resources). (46)
\bttq What were the crops like during the first seven years that Joseph was in charge?
\tqe The crops produced exceptionally well. They produced much more grain than they did in normal years. (47)
\bttq What did Joseph do during those first seven years?
\tqe When the people harvested grain, he had a portion of the grain stored in barns/granaries/warehouses in each town/city. (48)
\bttq Where did they store the grain?
\tqe They stored it in barns/granaries/warehouses in each town/city near where it grew. (48)
\bttq How much grain were they able to store?
\tqe They had so much that it filled all the storage places (until they overflowed) - so much that they could not account for all of it. (49)
\bttq What else happened during those years of abundant crops?
\tqe Joseph and his wife had two sons. (50)
\bttq What were the names of Joseph's sons?

\bttq As we consider the name which Joseph gave to his eldest son, Manasseh, what can we conclude about Joseph's attitudes/feelings (about his past experiences)?
\tqe God had helped Joseph not to feel angry or bitter regarding his brothers and his hard experiences. (51)
\bttq If someone wrongs us, do you think that we should remember what they did and take revenge, or should we forgive and forget the wrong that they did against us?
\tqe We should follow Joseph's example and forgive/forget.
\bttq What was the reason why Joseph named his second son "Ephraim"?
\tqe He gave him that name because it means "fruitful". And (just as a tree begins with nothing but later has fruit, so) Joseph began with nothing when he came to Egypt, but later he had achieved a high position of responsibility, and had a wife, and two sons. (52)
\tqref GEN 41.53-57

\tqe He told them to go to Joseph and to do whatever Joseph said (they were to do). (55)
\bttq Did Joseph give away the stored grain free of charge?
\tqe No, the people had to buy the grain from what he had stored in the barns. (54-55)
\bttq What did the people who had no food in the lands surrounding Egypt do?
\tqe They went to Egypt to buy grain. (57)

\oh Overview

\bttq Tell what happened with Joseph's family/Joseph's father and brothers during the time of famine.
\tqe They, too, had no food in Canaan because of the famine, so all of Joseph's brothers, except (for) Benjamin, went to Egypt to buy food. When they arrived, they had to go to Joseph to buy/get grain. They did not recognize him, but he recognized them. He accused the brothers of being foreign spies. They insisted that they were not spies, but rather were brothers who were in need of food. They mentioned that their father and youngest brother were still back in Canaan. Joseph told them that he would not believe them unless they brought their youngest brother to him. So he kept Simeon in jail, and sent the other nine brothers home to get/bring back Benjamin. When they arrived home, they found that the money that was to have been payment for the grain was in their grain sacks. They told Jacob about all that had happened. Jacob was very upset that now he had lost Simeon too (in addition to Joseph). So he said that he would not allow his nine sons/the brothers to take Benjamin back with them to Egypt, because he feared that Benjamin, too, would not return.

\bttq Who went to Egypt?
\tqe Joseph's ten older brothers went to Egypt. (3)
\bttq For what purpose did they go to Egypt?
\tqe There was famine in Canaan, but there was food in Egypt. Jacob's family had little or no food to eat, so Jacob sent ten of his sons to Egypt in order to buy food. (1-3)
\bttq According to Jacob, what would happen to their family, if his sons did not go to Egypt to buy food?
\tqe They would starve (to death). (2)
\bttq What is the reason that Benjamin did not accompany his brothers?
\tqe He stayed with his father, because (Jacob thought that) he was the only child of Rachel who was still living, and Jacob feared that something bad/harmful might happen to him. (4)
\bttq Were other foreigners also going to Egypt in order to buy food?
\tqe Yes, other foreigners were going to Egypt, because the famine had spread beyond Egypt. (5)
\tqref GEN 42.6-17
\bttq What was Joseph's government/political position at that time?
\tqe He was governor/master/ruler in Egypt. Only Pharaoh had more power/authority than Joseph.

\bttq When Joseph and his brothers met, what did his brothers do?
\tqe The brothers bowed to the ground in front of Joseph. (6)
\bttq What did Joseph do at that time?
\tqe He recognized his brothers, but he pretended that he did not recognize them. And he questioned them roughly concerning where they had come from. (7)
\bttq What do you think prevented Joseph's brothers from recognizing him?
\tqe At that time, Joseph was 30 years old, and they had not seen him since he was 17 years old. Also, he was wearing Egyptian clothes, and was using his Egyptian name, and he was a very high official. (41:14,42,45-46; 42:8)
\bttq What do you think might have caused Joseph to remember what he had dreamt so many years ago?
\tqe Perhaps it was because his brothers bowed to him. (6,9)
\bttq What did Joseph say was his brothers' purpose in coming to Egypt?
\tqe He said that they were spies, that they wanted to see if it would be easy to conquer the land of Egypt. (9)
\bttq Do you think that Joseph truly supposed that those men were spies?
\tqe No, he did not. (He was probably testing them.)
\bttq When Joseph said that they were spies, how did they respond?
\tqe They said that they had come only to buy food, and that they were honest/truthful men. They added that they were all brothers, and were not spies. (10-11)
\bttq What did Joseph reply?
\tqe He repeated his earlier claim that the men had come to see if it would be easy to conquer the land of Egypt. (12)
\bttq So what did the brothers say then?
\tqe They explained that they were all the sons of one father, and that their father and one younger brother were still living in Canaan. (13)
\bttq Who was the younger brother whom they mentioned?
\tqe That was Benjamin. (13)
\bttq Did the brothers say anything about their brother, Joseph?
\tqe Yes, they said that he was no longer with them/he was lost/he had died. (13)
\bttq At that time, what did Joseph demand that his brothers do in order to prove that what they said was really true?
\tqe Joseph said that one of the men must go home and then bring back their younger brother to him. Meanwhile, the other brothers must stay in jail in Egypt. (15)
\bttq According to Joseph, if the youngest brother does not come to him (Joseph) in Egypt, what would Joseph conclude about all the brothers?
\tqe He said that he would know that the men were spies. (16)
\bttq It seems as though Joseph did not trust his brothers. What was the reason that this might be the case?

\bttq How many days were the brothers in prison?
\tqe They were in prison for three days. (17)
\bttq In your opinion, how do you think the brothers felt while they were in prison?

\tqref GEN 42.18-24
\bttq After the brothers had been in prison for 3 days, what happened?
\tqe Joseph went to them and told them that instead of sending one brother home to get/to bring back the youngest brother, he (Joseph) would keep only one brother in prison. All the others could return home. (19)
\bttq What did Joseph say was the reason why he showed mercy to them in that way?
\tqe He said that he feared/respected God. (18)
\bttq If someone fears/respects God, would you expect them to show mercy to other people?

\tqe They were to take food back (to Canaan), and then they were to return to Egypt bringing their youngest brother. (19,20)
\bttq What did Joseph say that he would do if the brothers brought back their youngest brother to Egypt?
\tqe Joseph told them that he would free the one brother (Simeon); he said that he would not execute them as spies. (20)
\bttq What did the brothers say about why they were experiencing those problems/difficulties?
\tqe They said that the problems/difficulties were payment/retribution/penalty for having been cruel to Joseph (many years ago). (21)
\bttq During that time, years ago, when they had put their brother Joseph in the pit/cistern, and then sold him to the traders, what reaction had they seen and heard from Joseph?
\tqe They had seen him terrified, and had heard him pleading for mercy. (21)
\bttq And when they had seen and heard how he had reacted, what had they done?

\tqe He said that they would suffer retribution/revenge for having mistreated Joseph. (22)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that the brothers still remembered something that they did so long ago?
\tqe It is often difficult to forget sins. When we sin, there are consequences, and God will judge and punish those who have been cruel to others. (21-22)
\bttq Did Joseph understand what his brothers were saying?
\tqe Yes, Joseph could still understand the language that his family spoke. (23)
\bttq Did the brothers realize that Joseph was able to understand them?
\tqe No, they did not realize that. (23)
\bttq What do you think is the reason the brothers supposed that Joseph did not understand what they were saying?
\tqe They supposed that Joseph was an Egyptian who did not know their language. When Joseph had communicated with his brothers, he had done so through an interpreter. (23)
\bttq As Joseph heard the brothers express their regret for what they had done to him years ago, how did Joseph feel?
\tqe He was very upset. He went into another room and cried. (24)
\bttq What did Joseph do next?
\tqe He returned to his brothers and spoke some more with them. Then he had someone tie up Simeon while the other brothers watched. (24)
\bttq What would happen to Simeon? For what purpose did Joseph have him tied up?

\tqe He rebuked/blamed them for telling the man that they still had a younger brother at home. (6)
\bttq What was their answer to Jacob?
\tqe They said that they were only answering the questions that the man had asked them. They said that they could not have known that the man would have demanded that they bring their youngest brother to Egypt. (7)
\bttq What did Judah say at that time to his father?
\tqe He urged Jacob to send Benjamin along and he (Judah) would ensure Benjamin's safety. Judah pointed out that they needed more food, or else they and their families would all die. (8-9)
\bttq How do we know that a long time had passed since the brothers first returned home from Egypt?
\tqe Judah said that they could have made two more trips to and from Egypt, if they had returned immediately with Benjamin. (10)
\bttq What did Jacob decide at that time?
\tqe Jacob decided that he must allow Benjamin to go to Egypt. So he sent expensive gifts, and double the payment for the grain. (11-14)
\bttq For what reason do you think that Jacob sent double payment?
\tqe Probably he intended that his sons have enough money to pay for the grain from the first trip, as well as (for that which they would buy on) this second trip. (12)
\bttq What did Jacob say was possibly the reason that someone had placed the money in their (grain) sacks?
\tqe He said that someone might have made a mistake/oversight. (12)
\bttq Tell me about the gifts that Jacob had his sons take to Egypt.
\tqe They were probably special things that might not have been readily available in Egypt. They included types of nuts (pistachio nuts and almonds), honey, and some plant juice/sap/liquid which was probably used as medicine or perfume. (11)
\bttq What did Jacob say as a blessing for/to his sons on their journey? -OR- What did Jacob request of God for his sons, as they prepared to leave for Egypt again?
\tqe Jacob prayed that God would show mercy to his sons, when they met with the man in charge of selling the grain in Egypt. He prayed that Simeon and Benjamin would be able to return. (14)
\bttq If Benjamin and Simeon do not return, what would Jacob do?
\tqe He would grieve deeply, but would also accept it (as God's will). (14)

\bttq Tell me about what Joseph's brothers experienced on this occasion.
\tqe First, they told the man in charge of Joseph's household about the money that the brothers had found in their grain sacks. The man answered that they did not need to worry about that. Then the man released Simeon from jail and brought him to his brothers. Joseph spoke briefly with them about their father and about Benjamin, the youngest brother. Then Joseph fed them a special meal.
\dh Details
\tqref GEN 43.18-25
\bttq What do you think is the reason that the brothers were afraid to go to Joseph's home?
\tqe It was very unusual for someone in Joseph's high position to invite a group such as those to his home. The brothers tried to understand why this was happening. They supposed that someone might have reported that, when the brothers got grain the first time, they did not pay for it. And now Joseph might punish them as though they had stolen the grain. (18)
\bttq What did the brothers suppose that Joseph might do to them if he thought that/because they had not paid for the grain?
\tqe They were afraid that Joseph would make them his slaves and take their donkeys. (18)
\bttq What did the brothers do in order to try to solve the problem?
\tqe They talked to the man in charge of Joseph's household, and tried to pay again for the grain which they had received on the first trip. (19-22)
\bttq What was the steward's answer to them?
\tqe He told them not to be afraid. He said that the appropriate person/office had truly received the brothers' payment. And he told them that maybe God had put the money back into their grain sacks. (23)
\bttq After they spoke about the grain payment, what did Joseph's household manager do?
\tqe He released Simeon from jail and brought him to his brothers. (23b)
\bttq What did Joseph's servants do next?
\tqe They welcomed the brothers into Joseph's home, and gave them water to wash, and food for their donkeys. (24)
\bttq What did the brothers do while they waited for Joseph to come home?
\tqe They prepared the gifts that they had brought for him. (25)
\tqref GEN 43.26-34
\bttq When Joseph arrived (at) home, in what manner did the brothers greet him?
\tqe They brought their special gifts, and bowed low/bowed to the ground in front of him. (26)
\bttq What did Joseph ask them?
\tqe Joseph asked them how they were/if they were well. And he asked whether their father was still alive. (27)
\bttq What was the brothers' response?
\tqe They said that their father was (still) alive and well, and then they bowed again in front of Joseph. (28)
\bttq When the brothers bowed in front of Joseph, were they worshipping him as though he was God?
\tqe No, they were showing respect to him since he was a man of very high position.
\bttq When Joseph saw Benjamin, what did Joseph say?
\tqe Joseph asked God to bless Benjamin - to show favor or kindness to him. (29)
\bttq What happened next?
\tqe Joseph felt overwhelmed by his emotions, so he went quickly into his room to cry. (30)
\bttq Then what did Joseph do?
\tqe He washed his face (so that people no one would see that he was/felt upset), came out of his room, and ordered his servants to bring the food. (31)
\bttq Tell me about the seating arrangements for the meal.
\tqe Joseph sat alone, and his brothers ate together as a group, seated/arranged in order of their age. The Egyptians ate together, separated from Joseph and his brothers. (32)
\bttq What is the reason that the Egyptians did not eat/sit together with Joseph's brothers?
\tqe The Egyptians despised/looked down on the Hebrews. // The Egyptians considered the food of the Hebrews (as) taboo. (32)
\bttq What was it about the seating arrangements which caused Joseph's brothers to be very surprised?
\tqe Joseph/Joseph's servant had told the brothers where they were to sit. That seating arrangement was in order of age - from the eldest to the youngest. (33)
\bttq Tell me about the manner in which the brothers received their food.
\tqe Someone brought them their food from Joseph's table. And Benjamin received five times more food/much more food than his brothers. (34)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Joseph gave special treatment to Benjamin?
\tqe Perhaps he did this to honor Benjamin, since Benjamin was Joseph's only full-brother. (The others were Joseph's half-brothers.) Also, perhaps Joseph was testing his brothers to see if they would treat Benjamin in the same manner as they had treated Joseph when their father gave Joseph special treatment.
\bttq Do you think that the brothers were ashamed or afraid to eat or drink very much?
\tqe No, they ate and drank freely. (34)

\bttq After Joseph's brothers bought their grain and left for home, what happened?
\tqe The man in charge of Joseph's household chased after/pursued them and accused them of stealing a special cup from Joseph. The brothers denied it. The man searched their grain sacks and found the cup in Benjamin's sack. He said that Benjamin would have to stay in Egypt as a slave. The brothers all returned to Joseph, and Joseph again said that Benjamin would have to stay as his slave. Then Judah spoke up. He told Joseph that their father, Jacob, would die if Benjamin did not return (with them) to Canaan. And Judah offered to remain in Egypt as Joseph's slave in place of Benjamin.
\bttq What do you think might have been Joseph's purpose in all of this?
\tqe Probably he was testing his brothers. Perhaps Benjamin had taken Joseph's place as Jacob's favorite son. And if the other brothers had not changed, then they would use this opportunity to get rid of Benjamin - to cause him to become a slave in Egypt as had happened to Joseph years ago. But if the brothers were sorry for what they had done to Joseph - and to their father, Jacob - then perhaps at this time they would do anything they could to keep Benjamin from being enslaved, and to return him to his father in Canaan.

\tqe They quickly unloaded their grain sacks from the donkeys. (11)
\bttq Describe how the servant searched for that silver cup.

\tqe Jacob had said that he had gone away/he had disappeared, presumably killed by a wild animal. And Jacob had added that he had never seen Joseph since that time. (27-28)
\bttq In what way did Judah show a much greater concern for his father at this time, than he did years ago, when Joseph had gone to find his brothers in the fields?

\bttq Since the purpose of the letter is to persuade Jewish Christians not to go back to the old Jewish religion, why do you think he told them all this about God's Son and the angels?

In that religion, the Jews had come to think that God was very far away, and in order to communicate with God, the gap had to be filled with beings like angels. Angels were thought of as very important and were worshipped. But the Son is the only one between God and man, and people are to worship only him.

\tqe It was hard for him to die on the Cross and endure having God turn his back on him. Furthermore he was a man as well as God's Son.

\tqe He was telling about people who cannot repent and now he is talking about a field.
\bttq Why? (or, the translator may need to ask what each part of the metaphor represents and "What does God do with a field/ground which produces well?")

\bttq The translator probably needs to discuss the names of the two rooms, Holy Place and Most Holy Place to be sure they are appropriate and not misunderstood. Perhaps the question should be, "Why do you think they called the rooms by these names?" or, "If someone told you a room or place was called by that name, what kind of place would you think it would be?"
\bttq What is incense and why do you think they burned it there?
\tqe Reasonable answers. It represented prayer but few people would know that. They probably will only know it is part of the worship, but not know its function.

\tqe He takes blood from an animal just killed to offer to God to pay for his own sin and the sin of the people.
\tqref HEB 9.8
\bttq What does this say about the Holy Spirit?
\tqe It says he used the tent with its arrangement of furniture and rules of worship to show that the way into the inner room where God lived was not yet open (so that anyone could enter anytime).
\bttq What else does it say about the way being open?
\tqe It says it would not be open as long as the way to come to God/a system of worship was being used in which men and priests could come no closer to God than that first room.
\tqref HEB 9.9
\bttq What does it say about gifts and animal sacrifices? What do we learn from them?
\tqe It says the tent and that way of worship shows people that animal sacrifices and gifts are not sufficient to make them free from sin (and thus acceptable to enter into the presence of God).
\tqref HEB 9.10
\bttq What else does it say about that way of worship? (or, Why was it not adequate?)

\bttq What else does it say about that way of worship? (or, If that way of worship was inadequate, why did they worship that way?)
\tqe God gave them that way of worship until the time he could change the system and give them a better way.

\bttq It says the High Priest took blood into the inner room once a year to pay for the sins of the people. Can you explain this a bit more? How was this blood supposed to pay for sin?
\tqe Be sure they have the idea that that blood was proof or evidence that an animal had died in their place to take the punishment for their sin.
\bttq What kind of sin was the blood supposed to pay for?
\tqe The general sinful nature of the people, not their specific sins.
\bttq It says the old way of worship showed that animal sacrifices and gifts were not sufficient to make people acceptable to God or not sufficient to make their hearts clean from sin. How did it show that? (see vs 8)
\tqe It showed it because, even after they sacrificed animals, they still could not go into that inner room where God lived.

\tqe It is like the agreement a person makes to give his possessions to someone when he dies (a will).

\tqref HEB 9.19-20
\bttq In the case of the First Agreement, who had to die?
\tqe Animals, calves.
\bttq What did Moses do with the blood?
\tqe First he read the terms of the Agreement, the rules about how the people were to live and worship, then he sprinkled everything with that blood, the book where the laws were written and the people.
\bttq For what purpose?
\tqe To start the Agreement, to put it into effect.
\tqref HEB 9.21-22
\bttq What else did Moses do?
\tqe He sprinkled that blood over the tent and the things used for worship there.
\bttq Why?
\tqe To make them acceptable to God, to remove (people's) sin from it, set them apart for him.
\bttq Why did he do it that way? (or, What else does it say about sin and blood?) (or, What does it say about how things were made "clean?")
\tqe Almost everything under the Old Agreement was made acceptable to God by sprinkling it with blood.
\bttq Why?
\tqe Because God cannot forgive sin unless there has been a sacrifice in which blood is shed.

\tqe Animal sacrifices were required to make the earthly place of worship acceptable to God.
\bttq If animal sacrifices were required to prepare a place for people and God to meet here on earth, what kind of sacrifice was required for the heavenly place of worship?
\tqe It had to be a far better sacrifice.

\bttq Why does he not go every year? (or, If Christ had had to take a sacrifice in to God every year as the Jewish priest did, what would he have had to do to be able to do that?)
\tqe If he went every year, it would mean that he would have to suffer and die many times.

\tqe He also died once and was judged by God.
\bttq Judged by God? For what?
\tqe For the sins of many people (not his own).
\bttq What else does it say about Christ?
\tqe When he comes to the earth again, he will not have to die again.
\bttq So what will he do?
\tqe He will rescue all those who are waiting for him and take them to live with God forever.
\dh Specifics (Review)
\bttq Why was it that the High Priest had to take the blood with him when he went into the Presence of God?

\bttq So why did Jesus have to take his own blood when he went into God's Presence in heaven?
\tqe To prove that he had died for the sins of people.
\bttq Why didn't he just take the blood of animals like the Jewish priests?

The disciples of Jesus often anointed sick people with oil when they asked God to heal them. Probably they poured or smeared oil on the forehead of the person. In this context the action seems to have been symbolic, although rubbing or massaging a person with oil was also practiced as a medical treatment in the ancient world. (See "anoint" in KBT.)

\an (Note: Check to see if "Word" or "Message" can be understood as a person.

\an (Note: This may refer to spiritual life or to all senses of the word ‘life'.)
\bttq Who do you think God is?
\tqe Key Term Check: In English, the term "God" with a capital "G" is used to refer to the one supreme Creator. The term "god" with a small "g", as in "a god" or "many gods", can refer to any spiritual being that people worship. The Greek word theos can be used in the same two ways.
\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralised. (Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)

\tqe He said, "Look! There is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of people/people's sin." (29)
\bttq What do you think John meant when he called Jesus "the Lamb of God"?
\tqe God had told the Jews to sacrifice a lamb, which would die for their sins. John meant that now. God was giving his only son, Jesus, to die for all people, so that God would forgive their sins.
\an (Note: Check for wrong implications here. In Moslem cultures, or other cultures where lambs are sacrificed, they may be able to pick up the implication that Jesus is the one who will be the sacrifice through which God will forgive sins. In such cultures, check that the appropriate word has been used for "lamb" to suggest this idea.) (29) (See "lamb of God" in KBT in the "sacrifice" entry.)
\bttq What do you think it means when someone sacrifices a lamb in this way?
\tqe Key Term Check: "Sacrifice" is the religious act of making a gift to God, or to some other powerful spiritual being, in order to establish, maintain, or restore a proper relationship between the sacrificer and the deity.

If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offense, is restored and the guilt of the offender is removed. (See "forgive" in KBT.)

\an (Note: The Jews never used the same dishes that Samaritans used. An alternative interpretation (less likely) is this: The Jews did not usually have anything to do with the Samaritans.)
\an (Note: According to the T.H., there was a Jewish religious regulation in force around A.D. 65 which stated that Samaritan women were in a state of perpetual ritual impurity from the time of their birth; and anyone, who had contact with them, would share that ritual impurity.

\tqe He was an ancestor of the Jews and the Samaritans. (12)
\an (Note: According to the T.H., "our" ancestor could be interpreted as inclusive or exclusive. If it is inclusive, then she and Jesus had a common ancestor in Jacob. If it is exclusive, then Jacob was an ancestor of the Samaritans and not of the Jews.)
\bttq According to that woman, to whom had Jacob given the well?
\tqe According to her, Jacob gave it to the [Samaritans]. (12)

\an (Note: According to Exegetical Helps, "our fathers" could be referring only to the Samaritans, or it could be referring to the Samaritans and the Jews.)

\tqe He said that, in the future, you [the Samaritans] will not worship the Father on the mountain or in Jerusalem. (21)
\an (Note: According to Exegetical Helps, "you will worship" must refer to the Samaritans.)

\tqe He said: "True worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth." (23)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by "in spirit and truth"?
\an (Note: "I do not know" would be an acceptable answer. There are various interpretations of this verse. According to Exegetical Helps, "spirit" could mean man's spirit or the Spirit of God. The T.H. states, that wherever the word "spirit" occurs unmarked in John's Gospel, the reference is to God's spirit. According to the NIV Commentary it is not likely that "spirit" here means the Holy Spirit. The human spirit is in mind here. One must worship, not simply outwardly but, in ones spirit. For "truth" the T.H. states that, in this Gospel, "truth" refers primarily to God himself.)
\bttq When is this going to happen?

\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralised. (Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)

\tqe Michael did not condemn the Devil with insulting words when he and the Devil argued about [who was to have] the body of Moses. (9)
\bttq Who do you think the Devil is?
\tqe Key Term Check: The form diabolos "the Devil" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew sªtªn "Satan". Satan is the chief enemy of God. He is the supreme evil spiritual being who leads and directs all other evil spiritual beings. (See "devil" in KBT in the "satan" entry.)

\bttq Many people had been writing about the same things. What were those things?
\tqe They had been writing about the events that had taken place among them. (1)
\an (Note: Luke used the words "among us". If your language uses one pronoun to include the listener within the group and another pronoun to exclude the listener, the pronoun used here should exclude Theophilus. The events happened among people whom Luke knew. They were groups of Jews and others who believed in Jesus. We do not know whether Theophilus was either a Jew or a believer when Luke wrote to him.)
\bttq What do you think those events were telling about?
\tqe They told about Jesus.

\rf Luke 1:5-25 An angel told Zechariah that his wife would bear his son, John the Baptizer.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 1.5-25
\bttq Tell me about the things that happened to Zechariah.
\tqe An angel appeared to Zechariah while he was working in the temple as a priest. The angel told him that his wife, Elizabeth, would have a baby son and that he must name him John. Because Zechariah and Elizabeth were very old and she had never been able to have a baby before, Zechariah did not believe the angel. Because he did not believe, the angel made him unable to speak until the baby was born. After Zechariah returned home, Elizabeth became pregnant.
\bttq What was so important about Elizabeth conceiving and bearing a son that Luke wrote about it to Theophilus?
\tqe An old, barren couple conceiving and bearing a child (7) would show that God was doing this. People would know that God had important work for John to do when he grew up (15-17).
\tqe John would prepare people for Jesus' coming (17).
\dh Details

\tqe He was a priest. (5)
\bttq What do you think a priest did when he worked?

\bttq How did Zechariah and Elizabeth act and live?
\tqe They lived in a way which God had said was right, obeying all his commands/commandments. No one could say they had broken God's laws. (6)
\an (Note: Because Luke explained here what "righteous" living is, a question about this Key Term will not be asked until it is used again at verse 17.)
\bttq What commands/commandments do you think that the Lord expects people to follow/obey?
\tqe Key Term Check: The answer should focus on actions like those named in the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20:1-17; Deut. 5:1-21), but may include other instructions God gave to his people as well.
\bttq To whom did Luke refer in the words "the Lord's commandments" (6), "the Lord's temple" (9) and "the Lord's angel" (11)?
\tqe He referred to God himself.
\tqe Key Term Check: The word "lord" refers to a person who has authority over another person. God has supernatural authority over all of mankind because he created everyone and everything in the world. See "Lord" in KBT in the "God" entry.
\bttq Why did Elizabeth have no children?

\bttq What kind of a building do you think a temple is?
\tqe Key Term Check: A temple is a place where people gather to worship/sing/pray/offer sacrifices to a spirit being. This one was for worshipping God. (See "temple" in KBT.) (9)
\bttq What were the people who were worshipping doing at the time Zechariah went inside the temple to burn incense for God?
\tqe They were praying. (10)
\bttq Where were they praying?
\tqe They were outside (the temple building, but not outside the temple grounds). (10)
\an (Note: This referred to the main building, which Zechariah had entered. The worshippers had not left the temple grounds.)
\an (Note: A footnote may be necessary to clarify that the temple was regarded as so holy that only the priests were permitted to enter into it [Lev. 9 and 16]. All the worshippers stayed outside the front of the building.)
\bttq What do you think that people do when they pray?
\tqe They ask someone, usually a spirit being, for help with their problems and needs or the problems and needs of other people. They thank and praise the spirit for his past help and blessings.
\an (Note: In the GNT, this talking is only with God.)

\an (Note: Because the last verses of this section are more difficult to remember and understand, you may want to read and ask the questions about the first verses before going on to the last ones. If the translation has paragraph breaks, follow that division. If there are no paragraph breaks in these verses, then divide the reading and questions as they are divided below.)
\tqref LUK 1.11-13
\bttq What happened while Zechariah was inside the temple?
\tqe An angel (of the Lord) appeared to him. (11)
\bttq Who do you think an angel is and what does he do?
\tqe Key Term Check: An angel is a good spirit being whom God created. He stays where God is and does whatever work God tells him to do. Often he carries a message from God to someone. (See "angel" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think an altar is?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is a table-like structure usually made of wood or piled stones. Gifts of incense, food, animals or other valuable things are set on its flat top to give to God or to other spirits. Often those gifts are burned up on the top of the altar. The altar of incense in the temple was made of wood and then covered with gold (Exod. 30:1-10; 37:25-29; 1 Chron. 28:18). (See "altar" in KBT.)
\bttq Pretend you are the angel and this table/chair/bench/tree is the altar. Show me where the angel was standing according to this verse.
\tqe (Because many languages describe "right" and "left" by referring to a person's or animal's "hands", an object like an altar cannot have a "right side" or a "left side", even though the Greek and English languages allow it. The object that the person is using to represent the altar should be at that person's left side as he/she faces you, the checker.
\tqe If the person is not standing in the correct place, you should go and stand in the correct position. Then ask the person to tell you the correct way to describe where you are now standing. That may be by saying that the altar was at the angel's left-hand side.)
\an (Note: A few writers say that the "right side" referred to Zechariah's right side, but the grammar here parallels other examples that are not disputed, such as Mark 10:37 and John 21:6.)
\bttq How did Zechariah feel when he saw the angel?
\tqe He was alarmed and afraid. (12)
\bttq What did the angel say to Zechariah about that?
\tqe Zechariah should not be afraid because God had heard [and was ready to answer] his prayer (about having a son). (13)
\bttq What else did the angel say about God answering Zechariah's prayer?
\tqe Zechariah's wife, Elizabeth, would give birth to his son and he must name the boy John. (13)
\tqe Key Term Check: Choosing the right name for a person or a place was extremely important to the Jews. See "name" in KBT.
\tqref LUK 1.14-17
\bttq Whom did the angel say would be happy that John was born?
\tqe He said that Zechariah himself and many other people, too, would rejoice. (14)
\bttq For what reason would they be so happy?
\tqe John would be important and honored in God's sight, that is, according to what God considers important. (14-15)
\an (Note: The person who answers may include things in his/her answer from the items in the answer below the next question. You may then skip over the next question.)
\bttq How would John's life show that he was an important worker for God?
\tqe He would never drink wine or any other drink that could make him drunk. (15)
\an (Note: A footnote may be needed to indicate that God required this of priests while they were on duty [Lev. 10:8-9]. He also required those who took the Nazirite vow to live like this [Num. 6:1-4].)
\an
\tqe He would be filled with the Holy Spirit right from his birth or even before that. // He would have the Holy Spirit in his life right from his birth or even before that. (15)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Holy Spirit is the spirit of the holy God. He works in people's hearts/spirits/lives on God's behalf, revealing God's will to us and guiding us to please God. See "Holy Spirit" in KBT in the "advocate, counselor" entry and also in the "spirit" entry.
\an
\tqe He would cause many Israelites/Jews to turn [their hearts/lives away from sin] to obeying God. (16)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "Israel" and "Jew" in KBT in the "Israel, Jew, Hebrew" entry.
\an
\tqe He would work with the same kind of power and spirit as [the prophet] Elijah had done. (17)
\an (Note: This may be translated:
\an "having the same determination and attitude as Elijah had",
\an -OR-
\an "having God's power and spirit the same as Elijah had.")
\an
\an (Note: Luke did not use the word "prophet" here, but you should ask the next question about the assistant's understanding of who Elijah was and what he had done.)
\bttq Who do you think Elijah was?
\tqe He was a prophet in Old Testament times (1Kng. 17-2Kng. 2).
\tqe He did many miracles and spoke God's messages to many people, including many kings.
\tqe He never died, but God took him up to heaven alive (2Kng. 2).
\an (Note: You may want to make a footnote or reference that in the last two verses of the Old Testament God said that he would send Elijah back to earth just before the savior would come. More than four hundred years later the angel Gabriel used those very same words when he told Zechariah what his son John would do. Jesus later said that John had done the same work in the same way as Elijah had done earlier [Matt. 11:14; Mark 9:11-13].)
\bttq What do you think a prophet does?
\tqe Key Term Check: A prophet tells people messages that come from the spirit world. In the Bible only the men who spoke messages from God were called prophets. They spoke for God about what he had done in the past or would do in the future. They told how that would affect the people who were listening to them. (See "prophet" in KBT.)
\bttq What was this important work that John would do when he grew up?
\tqe He would help many Israelites/Jews to turn their hearts to God (16) by turning their hearts to [love] their fellowmen/children, and by turning away from disobeying God to following the way of people who acted rightly. (17),
\an -OR-
\an He would go ahead of the Lord (their God) and get many people ready for him to come into their lives [physically and spiritually/to rule and reign]. (17)
\an (Note: The words "the Lord" as found here in some English translations is the word "him" in the Greek text. "Him" clearly refers back five words earlier to "the Lord their God" (vs.16). The Jews referred to only one spirit being as "the Lord" [see Deut. 6, especially vs.4]. Any words used in a translation that only allow for Jesus, the Messiah, to be understood in this verse need adjusting.)
\bttq What do you think a righteous person is like?
\tqe Key Term Check: A righteous person is one who wants to please God by living the way God says is the right way. (See verse 6 again. Also see "righteous" in KBT in the "just, justify" entry.)
\tqref LUK 1.18-20
\bttq What did Zechariah say when he heard that his wife would bear a son for him?
\tqe "I myself and my wife are too old. How will I know this will really happen?" (18)
\bttq Do you think that Zechariah's response showed that he believed the angel or that he did not believe him?
\tqe His words showed that he did not believe the angel/did not have strong faith.
\an (Note: The key terms of "believe" and "faith" are discussed in verse 20, below.)
\bttq How did the words of Zechariah show that he did not believe the angel?
\tqe He asked the angel to do something to prove that he had the power to do what he had said. (18)
\bttq What authority did the angel have to tell this message to Zechariah?
\tqe He, Gabriel, stood in the very presence of God, (that is, he was a special angel to whom God gave the important work to do). God had sent him to Zechariah to tell him this good news. (19)
\bttq What was the angel's good news?
\tqe God had heard Zechariah's prayers to have a child. He was going to give Zechariah a son (13).
\an (Note: The Greek word Luke used here means "tell good news". It is the same word he used regularly elsewhere in this book to indicate that God's plan to send the Messiah to save people was happening right then. That meaning is also in the words of the angel here (17), but it is not what a person would think of immediately. Zechariah's son would be preparing people for the Lord God's coming into the world in the person of his son, Jesus, to save them. That was "good news". If the language assistant includes this point in his/her answer, give him/her special praise.)
\bttq What sign did the angel give to Zechariah to prove that he was telling him the truth?
\tqe Zechariah would not be able to speak until the day those things happened, that is, the day that child was born. (20)
\bttq Why did Zechariah have this problem/difficulty?
\tqe He did not believe what the angel had said. (20)
\bttq What does it mean that a person believes (or does not believe) what another person has said?
\tqe Key Term Check: That person is convinced/sure in his mind, he completely trusts, that the speaker told the truth. (See "believe" in KBT. "Faith" is also discussed in that entry.)
\tqref LUK 1.21-22
\bttq What were the people who were standing outside the temple thinking?
\tqe They were amazed that Zechariah was staying such a long time in the temple. (21) (They did not know any normal reason why this should be happening, so it seemed very strange.)
\bttq What happened when Zechariah did come back out to them?
\tqe Zechariah was not able to speak to them, so he used his hands to make signs. (22)
\bttq What did the people think that Zechariah's actions meant?
\tqe The people then knew that he had seen a vision inside the temple. (22)
\bttq What do you think happens when a person sees a vision?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is like a person having a dream when he is wide awake and his eyes are wide open. The person often can see spirit beings and see or hear things he did not know about before. God helped Zechariah to see and hear the angel.
\tqref LUK 1.23-25
\bttq When did Zechariah return home?
\tqe He returned home when his time of serving in the temple was finished. (23)
\bttq What happened after he was back home?
\tqe His wife Elizabeth became pregnant. (24)
\bttq What did Elizabeth do then?
\tqe She just stayed in and around her house. She did not want a lot of people to see her. (24)
\bttq How long did she do like that?
\tqe She did that for five months. (24)
\bttq What did she say/think about being pregnant?
\tqe She said that this was the way the Lord had helped her. He was now taking away the disgrace/humiliation/shame she felt/had in the eyes of other people. (25)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that people humiliated Elizabeth or caused her to feel shame?
\tqe She had never borne a child, especially no son.

\rf Luke 1:26-38 An angel told Mary that she would bear God's son, Jesus.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 1.26-38
\bttq Tell me about the things that happened to Mary.
\tqe God sent an angel to tell Mary that she would have a baby son and that his name would be Jesus. Mary was surprised and frightened by this. She asked the angel how this could happen because she was not married yet. The angel said that God himself would cause her to become pregnant. Therefore, the child would be the son of God. Mary accepted that this was what God wanted for her, so she was willing for this to happen to her.
\bttq What was so important about Mary conceiving and bearing a son that Luke wrote about it to Theophilus?
\tqe A virgin conceiving and bearing a child would show that God was doing this. (27, 31, 34, 35)
\tqe This child, Jesus, would be referred to as (or called) the Son of God. (32, 35)
\tqe God would give him authority over Israel forever. (32)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 1.26-28
\bttq At what time did God send an angel to speak to Mary?
\tqe He sent the angel during the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy. (26)
\bttq Was this the same angel whom God had sent to speak to Zechariah or was this another angel?
\tqe He was the same angel, Gabriel. (19, 26)
\bttq What did Luke tell us about Mary?
\tqe She lived in the town of Nazareth in the district/province/state of Galilee. (26)
\tqe She was a virgin. (27)
\tqe She was promised in marriage to Joseph. (27)
\bttq What did Luke tell us about Joseph?
\tqe He was a descendant of [Israel's great king,] David. (27)
\bttq What did the angel say to Mary?
\tqe "Hello/Good Day, you to whom the Lord has shown great kindness. He is with you." (28)
\tqref LUK 1.29-33
\bttq What did Mary think after hearing him say that?
\tqe She was thoroughly confused/mixed up/in turmoil. (29)
\tqe She wondered what these unusual words of greeting really meant.
\bttq What did the angel say was the reason that Mary was not to be afraid?
\tqe God had decided to show special kindness to her. (30)
\bttq What was going to happen which would show God's kindness to Mary?
\tqe She would become pregnant and bear a [special] son. (31)
\bttq What did the angel say to show Mary that her son would be a special/important person?
\tqe The angel told her the name God had chosen for the child, the name Jesus. (31)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The angel told her what name she must give to the child. (31)
\tqe
\tqe Jesus would do important work for God, and people/God would call him the Son of the Most High/Supreme God. (32)
\tqe
\tqe The Lord [who is] God would make him a king, as his ancestor David had been. (32)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The Lord [who is] God would give him authority to rule like his ancestor [King] David had done. (32)
\tqe
\tqe Jesus' reign over the descendants of Jacob [Israel/God's people] would never end. (33)
\tqref LUK 1.34-37
\bttq After hearing that she would bear a child, what did Mary ask?
\tqe She asked how this could happen since she had never had sexual relations with a man. (34)
\bttq What did the angel say about how Mary would become pregnant?
\tqe The Holy Spirit would do it supernaturally./The Holy Spirit would make it happen. (35)
\bttq What did the angel say would show that it was true that God made it happen?
\tqe The child would be holy and would be called the son of God. (35)
\bttq What do you think makes someone holy?
\tqe Key Term Check: God declares that person to be set apart from the way people live to please themselves. He sets them apart in order to totally serve him. That person would be morally pure, acting in all ways like God would act. (If you discuss how God is holy, see the question at verses 49b-50 below.)
\bttq Why did the angel tell Mary that Elizabeth was pregnant?
\tqe Elizabeth, who had been unable to have children and now was very old, was already into her sixth month of pregnancy. Since that seemed impossible, but was true, then nothing would be too difficult for God to do. [Mary, too, would have the baby the angel was telling her about.] // Whatever God says will happen, he will use his great power to make happen. He had already helped old Elizabeth become pregnant. [Therefore, Mary should believe what the angel was telling her also.] (36-37)
\tqref LUK 1.38
\bttq When the angel talked earlier with Zechariah, Zechariah did not believe that what the angel said would really be able to happen. How did Mary respond to the angel's message to her?
\tqe She did believe him.
\bttq What did Mary say that showed that she believed him?
\tqe She said that she was ready to serve God, to allow him to use her in the way the angel had said. // Because she thought of herself as God's servant/slave, she would be happy for him to use her in the way the angel had said.
\bttq What do you think a slave is?
\tqe Key Term Check: A slave is a person who must do whatever his/her master wants because the master owns the person as a possession. The slave is not free to do what he likes or go where he likes. (See "servant, slave" in KBT.)

\rf Luke 1:39-45 Mary visited Elizabeth.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 1.39-45

\dh Details
\bttq What did Mary do in the days following the angel's visit to her?
\tqe She got ready and went quickly to the town where Elizabeth lived. (39)
\bttq How long a time does it sound like Mary traveled to go to Elizabeth?
\an (Note: Because the distance Mary traveled would have been more than 70 miles (115 km.), the translation of "went quickly" should allow for 3-4 days of travel.)
\bttq Where was the town where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived?
\tqe It was in the hilly/mountainous region of Judah (Judea). (39)
\an (Note: Luke wrote the name as "Judah", the Jews' traditional name for the area, the name used in the Old Testament. It referred to the descendants of Judah, whom God had told to live there. At the time Zechariah and Elizabeth lived there, the Roman government called the area the province of "Judea". That name is used elsewhere in the New Testament. Whichever name is in your translation, it should be clear to the readers as to what the name refers, whether to a tribal/clan territory or to a government name.)
\bttq What happened when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting?
\tqe The baby in Elizabeth's womb leaped/jerked/moved excitedly for joy. (41, 44)
\tqe The Holy Spirit filled/inspired Elizabeth to speak out with a loud voice/excitedly. (41)
\bttq What did Elizabeth say about God's kindness towards Mary?
\tqe God was blessing her more than he had blessed any other woman. (He was also blessing the child she would bear.) (42)
\bttq What does it mean to bless someone and to be blessed?
\tqe Key Term Check: One person praises/says good things about the other person or asks God to do good things for that person. (See "bless, blessed, blessing" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think this special blessing from God was which Elizabeth was talking about?
\tqe Mary would give birth to God's son. No other woman would have that privilege and honor.
\bttq What had the Holy Spirit revealed to Elizabeth about Mary's baby?
\tqe He would be Elizabeth's Lord. (43)
\an (Note: What Elizabeth said shows us that she already knew the baby in Mary's womb was the savior God had promised, even God himself.)
\bttq How did Elizabeth feel about such an important person coming into her home?
\tqe She felt unworthy/undeserving of such an honor. (43)
\bttq How did she know that Mary was pregnant and that Mary's baby would be her own Lord?
\tqe At the same time that she heard Mary greet her, the baby in her own womb leaped/jerked/ moved excitedly for joy. That confirmed to her that what she had learned from the Holy Spirit was true. (41, 44)
\bttq What did Elizabeth feel was the reason that Mary was so blessed/fortunate/in such a happy state?
\tqe Mary believed that what the Lord had said to her [through the angel] really would happen. (45)

\rf Luke 1:46-56 Mary praised God.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 1.46-56
\bttq Why did Mary want to talk about these things?
\tqe She wanted to express her joy and praise to God for what he had done. (46-47, 49)
\bttq What did Mary say that God had done?
\tqe He thought about/remembered his people, her in particular (48), but also all of the Israelites (54).
\tqe He saved them from bad kings [and other dangers]. (47, 52)
\tqe He helped her (48) and all of the Israelite people (53-54).
\tqe He was merciful to them (50, 54) as he had promised (her forefathers, such as Abraham and his descendants,) long ago (55).
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 1.46-48
\bttq What did Mary say it was that made her very joyful?
\tqe God [cared about her and] had taken notice of her, even though she thought of herself as only a servant/slave of God / only a very ordinary, unimportant person. (48)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "servant/slave" above at 1:38. Also see "servant, slave" in KBT.
\tqe Key Term Check: See "soul" and "spirit" in KBT. The Jews used sets of synonyms to create parallel lines in their Hebrew poetry. Thus, a person can understand "soul" and "spirit"  in verses 46 and 47 as synonyms for Mary herself. However, elsewhere in the Bible "soul" refers to a person's inner self, that part we call "life" itself. It refers more to the humanness of a person, that is, his physical aspects rather than his spiritual aspects. "Spirit", on the other hand, refers to a person's relationship with the supernatural world, especially God. Both the physical and the spiritual aspects of Mary, that is, her whole self, was very joyful.
\tqref LUK 1.48-49
\bttq What would show that God had truly taken special notice of her?
\tqe From that time onward all generations would refer to Mary as having a special blessing from God. (48)

\tqref LUK 1.49-50
\bttq Because God had chosen Mary to be the mother of the Savior, what did she understand better about God?
\tqe He is always holy and very merciful to all those people who are in awe of him/those who revere and respect him as God.
\bttq What do you think it means that God is holy?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is perfectly good and right in everything he is and does. There is nothing bad, wrong or evil in him or in what he does. No one else is like him. We honor and worship him because he is like that.
\bttq What do you think it means that God is very merciful?
\tqe Key Term Check: He has deep feelings of genuine compassion/loving concern for people and, because of that, he does not punish their sin/wrongdoing as they deserve. (See "mercy" in KBT.)
\tqref LUK 1.51-53
\bttq What are some of the ways in which God has used his power/strength to help his people?
\tqe He has scattered those people who think proud thoughts about themselves. (51)
\tqe He has brought the reign and high status of [some] kings to an end (52a),
\tqe but given increased status to the humble people/and made humble people important (52b).
\tqe He has generously given those people with [spiritual] needs everything they needed, even more,
\tqe but has taken away the good things [of this world] from those who trusted in them [instead of trusting God]. (51-53)

\tqe People came to circumcise and name the baby. (59)
\bttq What do you think that the people did to this new baby boy when they circumcised him?
\tqe Key Term Check: They cut off the ring of foreskin from around the boy's penis. (See peritemnw in L&N in entry 53.51.)
\an (Note: If the translator is using the name of a cultural ceremony, ask about all its implications physically, culturally and spiritually. The Jews did the ceremony as a religious rite which dedicated the child to God and physically marked him as a Jew. If the translator's culture does not practice circumcision, describing the action may sound offensive and vulgar to any mixed group of men and women or children. The translator may need to use a more general word or phrase in the translation and refer to a footnote or glossary item. In that note the translator can explain clearly what is done to a male's body and tell why it was customary to do it on a Jewish baby's eighth day [Gen. 17:9-14; Lev. 12:1-3].)
\bttq What problem came up among the people at Zechariah's house that day?
\tqe The friends and relatives wanted to call/name the boy (his father's name,) Zechariah. (59, 61)
\tqe But Elizabeth strongly told them, "No", and said that he would be named/called John. (60)
\bttq How did the visitors and Zechariah communicate with each other?
\tqe They used [hand] signs/sign language. (62-63)
\bttq How did Zechariah show what he thought about the boy's name?
\tqe He asked for something on which to write and he wrote the name John. (63)
\bttq Why were all the people amazed at Zechariah's answer?
\tqe They did not know any reason for his answer because neither the boy's father nor any other relative was being honored by giving him that name. (61)
\tqe Also, both the father and mother agreed that the child's name was to be John. (60, 63)
\bttq Why did Zechariah and Elizabeth name the boy John?
\tqe They named him John because that was the name the angel had told Zechariah to name him even before Elizabeth was pregnant. (1:13)
\bttq What happened to Zechariah at the moment he wrote the name?
\tqe He was able to speak again. (64)

\tqe and they said, "What will this child be [when he grows up]?" (66b)

\bttq How did Zechariah know about all these things?
\tqe The Holy Spirit was in him, guiding his thinking as he spoke. (67)
\bttq What do you think that Zechariah did when he prophesied?
\tqe Key Term Check: He spoke the message that God's spirit guided him to say about the past and the future. He reminded the people that, with the birth of John, God was beginning to do what he had said in the past that he would do.
\bttq What kind of help had God given to his people Israel?
\tqe God had come to set his people free (68) from their enemies (71). // God had come to release his people (68) from the control of their enemies (71).
\tqe Key Term Check: See "redeem, redemption, ransom" in KBT.
\an (Note: The translation of "enemies" should allow for spiritual enemies as well as human enemies.)
\bttq How was God going to set his people free?
\an He was sending a powerful savior (69), just as he had promised through his prophets long ago (70).
\tqe Key Term Check: For understanding the time frame which Zechariah used, see "age" in KBT in the "world, age" entry.
\bttq What does a savior do?
\tqe Key Term Check: He rescues/saves another person who is in danger of being hurt or even dying, if someone does not help him quickly. (See "save, salvation, savior" in KBT.)
\bttq From which well-known family would this savior come?
\tqe He would be a descendant of [former king] David who had served God. (69)
\bttq What kind of a relationship do you think that David had with God? (69)
\tqe David wanted to help/please God, so he did what God asked him to do. God was pleased with David.
\an (Note: Although English translations use the word "servant", the Greek word is not the same one normally translated "servant" or "slave". The word used here is normally translated "child", and in the context here the focus is on the kind of loving help a child gives his father.)
\bttq Zechariah said that God was sending a savior. What did that show to Zechariah?
\tqe It showed him that God was being merciful to Abraham and the other [Israelite] forefathers. He (God) was doing what he had promised/said he would do in the covenant he had made with them. (72-73)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe God was being merciful to the [Israelites'] ancestors by continuing to keep his part of the covenant promise that he had made to Abraham and the other forefathers. (72-73)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe God was being merciful just as he had firmly promised to Abraham and the other forefathers. (72-73)
\bttq What is a covenant?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is an agreement, an especially binding promise, usually made by two people who are of equal status. If the person on one side of the covenant does not do as both have agreed, there usually is a strong punishment for him or he pays compensation to the other person. Today it would be called a contract. But the Greek word that is used in the Bible for covenants strongly implies that the terms of the agreement were stated by the person on only one side of the discussion, not both sides. Usually God is the one who says what will happen, that is, what he will do and what people must do. He binds himself to the other party. (See "covenant" in KBT.)
\tqe (Note: If the language has a special name to refer to these kinds of agreements, ask the assistant(s) to tell you the kinds of situations in which the people make these special agreements, these firm promises. Listen for any points where it would not be appropriate to state that God made that kind of an agreement. If there are some questionable areas, the translator may need to re-think how he used that term in the translation.)
\bttq What do you think made this covenant a holy one? (72)
\tqe Key Term Check: It was holy because God, who made it, is holy. It came from God, he spoke it, so it had the same characteristics that God has.
\bttq What does a person do when he swears an oath? (73)
\tqe Key Term Check: He uses strong, positive words to show that he will truly do as he has just promised. He also calls on God (Mark 14:71) or another spirit being (Josh. 23:10; Jer. 13:16; Amos 8:14) to punish him very badly if anything he has just said is not completely true. (See 2 Sam. 3:35.)
\bttq What do you think will assure a person that God will do what he promises?
\tqe God is holy [Amos 4:2] and has all the power necessary to do anything he says. When he makes a promise, the other person will know for sure that God will do it.
\an (Note: Sometimes God says he swears by himself. [See Gen. 22:16, where you will find the covenant and oath Zechariah was talking about here.] He also swears by his name, that is, his reputation [Isa. 45:23]. Since God has never failed to keep his promises in the past and has never done any other bad action, he surely will not lie now, either [Ps. 89:34-35].)
\bttq What had God promised to Israel's ancestors?
\tqe He had promised to rescue them / save their people from being under the control of people who hated them/who were their enemies. (71, 74)
\tqe He would make them able to serve him without fearing (him).
\tqe -OR-
\tqe  … without fearing (that their enemies would persecute or attack them). (74)
\bttq How will they serve God without being afraid? (75)
\tqe They will serve him by doing what is right in the sight of God and man the rest of their lives.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They will serve him by being pure in their hearts and in their actions the rest of their lives.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They will serve him by not doing what is wrong, but by doing what is right the rest of their lives.
\an (Note: The three choices for verse 75 are the main interpretations of how the words "holiness" and "righteousness" relate to each other when they are found in the same sentence.)
\tqref LUK 1.76-79
\bttq In what way will John be a part of God's plan to send a savior?
\tqe He will go ahead of the Lord/savior to prepare the way for people (to accept him). (76)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He will go ahead of the Lord/savior to tell people to prepare their lives for his coming. (76)
\bttq What will people say about him because he does that work?
\tqe They will say he is a prophet of the Most High God/the Supreme God. (76)
\an (Note: If you already discussed the term "prophet" above in 1:17, skip over the next question.)
\bttq What work do you think that a prophet does?
\tqe Key Term Check: A prophet tells people messages which come from the spirit world. In the Bible only the men who spoke messages from God were called prophets. They spoke for God about what he had done in the past or would do in the future. They told how that would affect
\tqe the people who were listening to them. (See "prophet" in KBT.)
\bttq How will John prepare the people to be ready for the savior?
\tqe He will tell them that God will save them when they ask him to forgive/remove their sins. (77)
\bttq What is sin?
\tqe Key Term Check: Because God made all people and told us how to live to please him, every time a person's thoughts, words or actions do not follow what God has said is right, that is sin. It is a turning away from being like God wants us to be. (See "sin, sinner" in KBT.)
\bttq What does God do when he forgives sins?
\tqe Key Term Check: He removes any record of a person's wrong action. That means that there is no need for the person to compensate God in any way, such as by being punished or by giving him good things or doing extra actions which would please him. God does not think of that person as being a bad person any longer, but as a person who is ready to do good. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\bttq Why does God forgive people's sins?
\tqe It is because God has deep feelings of wanting to be merciful towards them. (78)
\bttq [IF THE TRANSLATION OF VERSES 78-79 HAS PICTURE LANGUAGE ABOUT THE SUN OR DARKNESS OR SHADOWS, ASK:]
\bttq Tell me what the picture language about the sun/darkness/shadows means to you?
\tqe [THE SUN:] The sun is a picture of the savior coming from heaven to start a new day, a new period in our lives. He makes it clear to us how he saves us. Now we are encouraged about what is going to happen to us.
\tqe [DARKNESS/SHADOWS:] The time of not knowing about the true God and of being afraid that something, perhaps God or evil spirits, might soon make us die, ends. (78-79)
\bttq Where is this place that Zechariah said the savior would come from?
\tqe Key Term Check: He said that the savior would come from heaven, that is, from the place where God and other spirit beings live. (78) (See "heaven, sky" in KBT.)
\an (Note: The word needed here may be different from the word for the physical sky, even though Greek and English use the same word for both meanings. Use what is correct for the culture and language of the translation.)
\bttq What do you think this peace is to which Zechariah referred?
\tqe Key Term Check: This peace is a calm heart/spirit which does not worry when we face God because he has already forgiven our sins. (See "peace" in KBT.)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Long, long ago God promised mankind that he would send someone to save them from the punishment they deserved. Later, God sent Jesus into this world as that savior. When we see clearly that God already has done what he promised to do, we have peace in our hearts. Peace is a calm heart/spirit and being free from worry. (See "peace" in KBT.)

\bttq What did Luke tell us about John growing to be a man?
\tqe He matured physically and mentally.
\tqe Then he lived in an uninhabited area/the wilderness/desert until the time he began his work publicly among the people of Israel.

\rf Luke 2:1-7 Mary bore Jesus.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.1-7
\bttq What did Luke tell about in these verses?
\tqe He told about the birth of Jesus and why Joseph and Mary were in the town of Bethlehem at that time.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 2.1-3
\bttq What new order/command/decree did Augustus make?
\tqe He commanded that everyone whom the Roman government ruled should have his/her name recorded in the government records. (1)
\bttq Why was Augustus able to command all the people to do that?
\tqe He was the Caesar, the very highest government official in all the area which the Roman government ruled. (1) (He even ruled over the kings.)
\bttq Where were the people to go to record their names?
\tqe They were to go to the area/village where their ancestors had been born/had lived. (3)
\bttq Read the last verse of chapter 1 and the first verse of this chapter again. Will people think that Augustus commanded this when John was still a baby or after John had grown to be a man?
\tqe Augustus commanded this when John was still a baby.
\an (Note: According to the difference in the times when Elizabeth and Mary became pregnant [see 1:26-36], John would have been about six months old when this next event happened.)
\tqref LUK 2.4-7
\bttq What did Joseph do when he heard about the command to register/record his name?
\tqe He also obeyed the government's command to have their officials record his name in their book. (4, 5)
\tqe He left the town/village of Nazareth in [the province of] Galilee (4a)
\tqe and traveled to the town/village of Bethlehem in [the province of] Judea. (4b)
\tqe He traveled with Mary, the young woman who was promised in marriage to him. (5)
\bttq Why did Joseph go to the village of Bethlehem?
\tqe That was the village where Joseph's ancestor, (the famous king) David, had lived. (4b)
\bttq What do we learn about Mary from hearing/reading these verses?
\tqe She had been promised to Joseph to be his wife. (5)
\tqe She was pregnant. (5)
\tqe She went with Joseph to have the officials record their names in the government book. (4, 5)
\tqe She delivered a baby boy, her first child, while she and Joseph were at Bethlehem. (6-7)
\bttq How did Mary care for her baby son?
\tqe She wrapped him in pieces of cloth (according to the Jewish custom of that time) and laid him in a manger/an animal's food trough/box. (7)
\bttq Why did she have to use an animal's food box as the baby's bed?
\tqe Because all the places for travelers to stay (the inns/hotels) were already full of people, Joseph and Mary had to stay in the place where people usually fed their animals. (7)

\rf Luke 2:8-20 An angel told some shepherds about the baby and they went to see him.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.8-20
\bttq God sent an angel at night with a message for some shepherds. What had happened that was so important for the shepherds to know?
\tqe The angel brought them the good news that the savior, Christ the Lord, had been born. (11)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 2.8-12
\bttq What were some shepherds doing the night when Mary bore her baby?
\tqe They were staying out in the open countryside guarding their flocks of sheep/goats at night. (8)
\bttq What caused the shepherds to be very much afraid?
\tqe They suddenly saw an angel standing in front of them (9a)
\tqe and the bright light of God's glory/presence was shining all around them. (9b)
\an (Key Term Check: The Greek word translated "glory" has many variations in meaning and use. Each meaning tries to describe a characteristic of God which people do not have. God is totally without sin. He is so different from sinful mankind that people find it hard to explain or describe what they see or experience when God makes his presence known.
\an You probably will not find a word in your language which includes every aspect of the Greek word for glory and would be correct for every use. You will probably find that the use of "glory" in verse 14 below is already different from its usage here. As much as you are able, translate any one aspect of "glory" consistently. See "glory" in KBT.)
\bttq Why did the angel tell the shepherds they should not be afraid?
\tqe They were not to be afraid because he had come to tell them some good news which would cause all people to rejoice greatly. (10)
\bttq What was that good news?
\tqe The good news was that the savior had been born that same night. (11)
\tqe Key Term Check: Luke used the Greek word which means "tell good news." It is the same word he used in 1:19 and we will see it again at 3:18 and 4:18, among many other places. Luke always used it to refer to the good news that God's plan to send the Messiah to save people was already happening. That is also the meaning of the angel's words here [10-11.)
\bttq What did the angel say to indicate that this savior was someone very special?
\tqe He said that this savior was the Christ (the anointed one sent by God) and Lord (the one with authority to rule and reign over people [See Mic. 5:2]). (11)
\tqe Key Term Check: Make sure that the title "Christ" is understood to be just that, a title, not a personal name. You may wish to make a footnote or glossary entry which indicates that this is the Greek equivalent to the Hebrew title "Messiah". See "Christ, Messiah" in KBT.
\bttq Where did the angel say the savior was born?
\tqe In the village where [their ancestor, King] David had lived (that is, in Bethlehem). (11)
\bttq What would the shepherds see which would prove to them that what the angel said was true?
\bttq -OR-
\bttq How would the shepherds know if they had found the baby which the angel was talking about?
\tqe They would find the baby wrapped in pieces of cloth (according to their Jewish custom) (12b)
\tqe and lying in a manger, that is, an animal's food trough/box. (12c)
\bttq What do you think is the reason this would be a sign to them?
\tqe People do not customarily put their babies into any animal's food box.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The Jews would not expect to find the savior, whom they expected God to send to earth, in such a humble place as a manger.
\tqe Key Term Check: See "sign" in KBT in the "miracle, sign, wonder, mighty work" entry.
\tqref LUK 2.13-14
\bttq What suddenly happened near that angel?
\tqe A great number of other spirit beings from heaven (angels) appeared. (13)
\bttq What were those angels doing?
\tqe They were praising God. (13)
\an (Note: The Greek word used here is not one of the eight words used in the rest of the GNT text to refer to songs and singing. It does not tell us whether the angels sang or not. The focus of this verb is on the content and purpose of the action, not the manner.)
\bttq What did their words of praise say about God?
\tqe There is glory for God in highest [heaven]. (14)
\an (Note: "Highest" may refer to either the place where God is, or the place where the praising is occurring. Either way is acceptable, but if it can refer to both, that is even better.)
\bttq What do you think this glory is? (14)
\tqe Key Term Check: It is the best praise, honor, and giving of thanks which can be given to God because of his perfect goodness to them.
\bttq What did the angels say about people?
\tqe They said that there is peace among the people on the earth whom God has favored/with whom he is pleased. (14)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "peace" discussed above at 1:79.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the angels said these things in their praising God?
\tqe They were happy that the Savior was born. He would bring that kind of glory to God and peace to mankind. (They recognized that, because the savior had been born, there now was this glory and peace in heaven and on the earth, and they were excited about it.)
\tqref LUK 2.15-20
\bttq When the angels finished praising God, what did they do?
\tqe They went back to heaven. (15)
\bttq What did the shepherds decide to do then?
\tqe They decided to go to Bethlehem and see this thing that [the angel of] the Lord had just told them about had happened there, [the savior had been born that day]. (15)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They decided to go to Bethlehem and see the savior whom [the angel of] the Lord had just told them had been born there that day. (15)
\bttq How do we know the men were very excited to go find this savior who had just been born?
\tqe They went hurriedly on their way. (16)
\bttq What did they find when they looked around the village of Bethlehem?
\tqe They located Mary and Joseph and saw the baby lying in the manger/an animal's food trough/box. (16)
\bttq After they had seen the baby, what did they do?
\tqe They told people, [including Mary and Joseph,] what [the angel] had said to them about this child. (17)
\bttq When the people heard the shepherds' story of what had happened, what did they think?
\tqe All of them were amazed. (18) (This kind of thing did not normally happen, so it seemed very strange.)
\bttq How did Mary respond to all that had happened regarding her baby?
\tqe She kept thinking about them, wondering very much about what they meant. (19)
\bttq After the shepherds had told people about these things, what did they do?
\tqe They returned [to where they had left their sheep flock outside the town]. (20)
\bttq As they went back there, what were they saying or doing?
\tqe They were honoring God and saying wonderful things about him./They were talking about the unsurpassed greatness and the goodness of God. (20)
\bttq What did Luke say was the reason for their joy?
\tqe Everything they had seen and heard was just as the angel had said that it would be. (20)

\rf Luke 2:21 Mary and Joseph name the baby Jesus.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 2.21
\bttq What happened on the eighth day of Jesus' life?
\tqe He was circumcised,
\tqe and [his parents] named him Jesus.
\bttq Why did Mary and Joseph name their baby boy Jesus?
\tqe It was the name the angel had told Mary to name him even before she was pregnant (1:31).
\an (Note: An angel had also told Joseph to name the baby that name.  [See Matt. 1:21.])
\an

\rf Luke 2:22-24 Mary and Joseph presented Jesus to God at the temple.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.22-24
\bttq Why did Mary and Joseph take the baby Jesus to the temple at that particular time?
\tqe The Lord [God] had said that parents must present/dedicate every firstborn male child to him (Exod. 13:2, 12, 15). (22-23)
\tqe They also were to bring a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons [and give them to a priest] to offer as a sacrifice. (22, 24)
\an (Note: The Law of Moses and the Law of the Lord are discussed below.)
\dh Details
\bttq Why did Mary and Joseph wait some weeks before they went to the temple to present the baby Jesus to God?
\tqe They waited for the days/time to end for Mary to be ritually pure/clean again. (22)
\an (Note: The Law of Moses said that for 40 days after a Jewish woman had delivered a baby, she was not ritually clean/pure, so they waited for that time to end. The woman had to bring a special offering [Lev. 12:2-8] in order to become ritually clean/pure again. After she did that, she would again be allowed to go to the temple and participate in religious activities.)
\bttq What do you think that Luke was talking about when he referred to being made pure/clean?
\tqe Key Term Check: The words "made clean" here refer to being clean ritually, thus being allowed again into the public worship and the presence of God. If the translator used a very general word like "clean," check to make sure it does not mean only to remove external things, such as dried blood or dirt from the skin. If the translator is using a cultural term for a ceremony which must be performed by local women when they wish to return to normal activities after childbirth, ask about all its implications physically, culturally and spiritually. See "clean, pure" and "unclean, defiled, impure" in KBT.
\bttq What is the Law of Moses?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Law of Moses is the laws and instructions which God had revealed to Moses. Although Moses wrote them down, they were God's laws for his people/the Jews/the Israelites to follow. That is why Luke referred to the same laws both as "the Law of Moses" (22) and as "the Law of the Lord" (23, 24).  (See "law" in KBT.)
\an (Note: The Jews collected what Moses wrote, and those writings now are the first five books of the Old Testament.)
\bttq What kind of sacrifice did Mary bring?
\tqe She brought two doves or two young pigeons. (24)
\bttq What happened to those two birds when they were sacrificed?
\tqe Key Term Check: The priest killed them in a way that God had told them to use for such animals. Then they were given to God by burning them up (see Lev. 3, 6:24-30, and 12:6-8). (See "sacrifice" in KBT.)

\rf Luke 2:25-35 Simeon saw the baby Jesus and prophesied.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.25-35
\bttq Tell me about Simeon going to the temple.
\tqe (The answer should include the basic facts and activities of the event. Those items not mentioned can be checked on in the detail questions below.)
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about Simeon being at the temple?
\tqe Simeon was one of the Israelites who was waiting for the savior (Messiah) whom God had promised to send to them. The Holy Spirit showed Simeon that the baby, Jesus, was that savior (25, 26, 30).
\tqe -OR-
\tqe We can learn that Jesus is the savior of all the other ethnic groups of the world, as well (31-32).
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 2.25-28
\bttq Tell me some of the things you heard/read about Simeon in this section.
\tqe He lived in Jerusalem.
\tqe He loved and honored God and did what was right in God's sight.
\tqe The Holy Spirit was in him. (25)
\tqe [He probably was quite old. (26)]
\bttq Who was Simeon waiting to see before he died?
\tqe He was waiting to see the one who would console/encourage/help Israel in the midst of/out of its troubles, that is the Christ/Messiah/savior whom God would send. (25-26)
\bttq How did Simeon know he would not die before he saw the Christ/(the Messiah)?
\tqe The Holy Spirit had revealed that to him. (26)
\bttq Why did Simeon go to the temple grounds that particular day?
\tqe The Holy Spirit caused him to go there. (27)
\bttq What did Simeon see there?
\tqe He saw the parents (Joseph and Mary) bring their baby, Jesus, into the temple grounds [to do what the Law of Moses said that they must do]. (27)
\bttq When Simeon saw the family, what did he do?
\tqe He received/held the baby Jesus in his arms and blessed/praised God [for sending him]. (28)
\tqref LUK 2.29-32
\bttq Simeon had not died before seeing the savior, just as God had revealed to him. What did Simeon say about how he felt now?
\tqe His was ready to die, because he had peace in his heart./God could allow him to die because he had peace in his heart. (29)
\bttq What did Simeon say caused him to have a peaceful heart?
\tqe He had seen the one through whom God would save his people, Israel, and all [other] ethnic groups./He had seen the one whom God had sent to save people from all ethnic groups. (30-32)
\bttq In what way, do you think, is Jesus like a light for the Israelites/Jews and for all the people who are not Jews? (32)
\tqe In the same way that light allows us to see what is in a dark place, when a person learns about Jesus' work as his savior, that person knows clearly what must happen in order for him to be saved from his sins.
\tqe The people of Israel already knew much about God, but now they would understand even more about him.
\tqe The people who were/are not Jews would really see the contrast between the way they lived before they knew about God and the life the savior made possible for them. It would be as if Jesus had turned on a light for them to see better.

\tqref LUK 2.33-35
\bttq What did Mary and Joseph think about what Simeon said about the baby?
\tqe They were amazed that he knew so much about the work Jesus would do. (33)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They were amazed that God had revealed some of the same things to Simeon about their baby that the angel had told them. (33)
\an (Note: They did not know any normal reason why Simeon should know these things without God showing them to him. It seemed very strange to them.)
\bttq What did Simeon do then?
\tqe He asked God to bless them and then spoke to Mary. (34)
\an (Note: The Greek text literally says "Simeon blessed them", but that means that he asked God to bless them. There are many other blessings which people spoke in the Bible which make this custom of giving a blessing clear to us.)
\bttq What, do you think, is the meaning of this picture language about many Israelite people falling and others rising because of Jesus?
\tqe Those Israelites who do not accept Jesus as their savior sent by God will fall away. That means that they will be separated from God and be a part of those people whose bad actions will lead to God destroying them (for all time to come).
\tqe Those others who do accept Jesus as their savior will rise above the sin of this world. That means that they will be separated from the bad things in this world and will be joined with God (for all time to come). (34)
\bttq What kind of a sign do you think that Jesus was to be? (Note: Any of these answers is good.)
\tqe People would see and realize that God's promises about sending a savior were being fulfilled in what Jesus said and did. (34)
\tqe He is the one through whom God shows the way for a person to be saved.
\tqe In Jesus, people would see God beginning to rule and reign in people's lives and they would also see how they were to live.
\bttq How would people respond to seeing this sign of Jesus in the world?
\tqe Many (people) would say bad things about Jesus (and things he would teach). (34)
\bttq What will happen to the many people who say or think bad things about this sign from God?
\tqe Their real thoughts would be clearly seen and would show that they were rejecting God and his plan to save them. (35a)
\bttq How will the action of people rejecting Jesus' life and work affect his mother, Mary?
\tqe She would feel great sorrow/anguish in her heart like the pain she would feel if someone pierced it with a sword. (35b)

\rf Luke 2:36-38 Anna spoke about the baby Jesus.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.36-38
\bttq What happened while Simeon was holding the baby Jesus and speaking to his parents?
\tqe [The woman/widow] Anna came up to them and thanked God for [sending] the child [to be the savior/Messiah].
\tqe She also told about this child to people who were waiting for God to set free the people [of Israel, represented here by those] living in Jerusalem. (38)
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about Anna being at the temple?
\tqe God's Spirit showed her also (36a) that the baby Jesus was the one God had sent to set free the people [of Israel]. (38).
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It was not just the man Simeon who realized that baby Jesus was the savior [that God had promised to send].
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Anna was another person who spread the good news that Jesus was the savior, starting already when he was only a few weeks old. (38)

\bttq Tell me some of the things you heard/read about Anna in this section.
\tqe She was a prophetess.
\tqe Her father was Phanuel and they had descended from Asher [one of Jacob's/Israel's sons].
\tqe She had married and then lived with her husband for 7 years [until he died]. (36)
\tqe After that, she was a widow and was now 84 years old.
\tqe She served/worshipped God by means of fasting and praying at the temple grounds from morning until night/all day long. (37)
\tqe (She, too, seems to have been waiting for God to send the one who would free his people [38].)
\bttq What do you think that Anna did when she fasted?
\tqe Key Term Check: She chose to not eat food for certain periods of time so that she could focus her thoughts better on God and not on her bodily needs. She especially used that time to pray and show that she was sorry for her sins.

\rf Luke 2:39-40 The family returned to Nazareth.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.39-40
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about the family returning to Nazareth?
\tqe Luke told Theophilus at the beginning of this book (1:1-4) that he wanted to present a true account of Jesus' life. Since Mary and Joseph had come to Bethlehem for having their names recorded, it would be natural for them to return home to Nazareth.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus did not grow up in his forefather King David's village of Bethlehem, nor in Jerusalem, where the temple of God was. He appeared to be an ordinary child in an ordinary family in an ordinary village.
\an (Note: People would have to accept him based on the way he lived and what he taught, not on his social status, which would be based on who his ancestors were or on his religious education.)
\dh Details
\bttq When were Joseph and Mary ready to return to their home in Nazareth?
\tqe They were ready when they had finished doing everything that the Law of the Lord commanded them to do [after having a baby boy]. (39)
\bttq What was happening to Jesus while the family lived in Nazareth?
\tqe He grew bigger and stronger and very wise. God also showed special kindness to him. (40)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "grace" in KBT.

\rf Luke 2:41-52 The boy Jesus went with his parents to the temple in Jerusalem.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.41-52
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about the boy Jesus going to the temple in Jerusalem?
\tqe Luke wanted the reader to know that Jesus was very wise, even at that early age. He knew the work God had given him [to be the savior]. (49)
\tqe Everyone who heard Jesus speak realized that he was very wise and that he wanted to please God. (47, 52)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 2.41-45
\bttq What was the reason that Jesus' parents went again to Jerusalem?
\tqe It was their custom to go there every year to celebrate the Feast of the Passover. (41-42)
\an (Note: Every Jew was to go to the temple in Jerusalem once a year. Many people chose to go at the time for this feast.)
\bttq What do you know about this Jewish feast?
\tqe Key Term Check: This feast was to remember how God's angel passed over the homes of the Jews when they were slaves in Egypt. The angel passed over them because they had put the blood of a perfect lamb on their doorposts as a sign. The Egyptians did not do as God had said, so the angel killed the oldest son and the firstborn animal young in every such house. Because of that, the Egyptian ruler allowed the Jews to leave Egypt and return to the land God had promised to them. (See "The Passover sacrifice" in KBT in the "sacrifice, offering, blood" entry.)
\bttq How old was Jesus when he went with his parents?
\tqe 12 years old. (42)
\an (Note: A footnote may be good here to indicate that this was the age at which Jewish boys and girls began to be considered/called adult men and women. As adults they had to do all the religious activities that God told the Jews to do, such as to worship in Jerusalem during the Feast of the Passover.)
\bttq What did Jesus and his parents do when the Feast days were finished?
\tqe While his parents started to return home to Nazareth, Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. (43-44)
\bttq Why were Mary and Joseph not worried about Jesus staying by himself in the big city?
\tqe They did not know that Jesus had stayed there. (43) They thought that he was with other people in the [large] group who were traveling together [towards Nazareth]. (44)
\bttq How much time passed before they really started to look for him?
\tqe They traveled one whole day and then started to look for him. (44)
\bttq Where did his parents look for him?
\tqe They looked for him among their relatives and friends [who also were traveling that direction]. (44)
\bttq What did they do when they did not find Jesus among those people?
\tqe They returned to Jerusalem to look for him there. (45)
\tqref LUK 2.46-48
\bttq On which day of their searching did his parents find him?
\tqe On the third day. (46)
\bttq Where was Jesus when they found him?
\tqe He was in the temple grounds sitting among the teachers [of the Jewish Law]. (46)
\bttq What was he doing there?
\tqe He was listening to them and asking them questions. (46)
\bttq What was the reason that everyone there was so astounded?
\tqe They were astounded at his good understanding and wise answers, [because he was only twelve years old]. (47)
\bttq What did his parents think of all this?
\tqe They were greatly astounded. (48)
\bttq What did his mother say to him about all this?
\tqe "Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been very worried as we have been searching for you!" (48)
\an (Note: When you translate the words "your father" to refer to Joseph, follow the custom of the people who will use this translation. Use the words normally used by a mother when she speaks to her children about her husband. Because Joseph was not the true physical father of Jesus, some languages may require a translator to use a word similar to "stepfather".)
\bttq Do the words of her question show that she was upset and frustrated, or do they show that she wanted Jesus to answer her question?
\tqe (Note: Her words should show that she was upset and frustrated. They should show or imply disapproval and finding fault with him.)
\tqref LUK 2.49-50
\bttq Jesus had not been with his parents for three days. What do you think was the reason that he asked his mother, "Why did you have to look for me?"
\tqe If they had thought about the reason that God had sent him into the world to do his (God's) work, they would have known that he would be in God's house, the temple. (49)
\bttq Did his answer help them understand the reason that he had stayed there in Jerusalem?
\tqe No, it did not. (50)
\tqref LUK 2.51-52
\bttq Now that Mary and Joseph were there with him, what did Jesus do?
\tqe He went home with them to Nazareth and obeyed them. (51)
\bttq How did Mary respond to all that had happened regarding her son?
\tqe She kept thinking about all these things and wondering very much about their meaning. (51)
\bttq What did Luke tell us about Jesus growing to be a man?
\tqe He matured physically and mentally./He grew taller and wiser. (52a)
\tqe He pleased both God and the people around him more and more by the way he lived. (52b)

\rf Luke 3:1-6 John the Baptizer prepared the way for Jesus.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 3.1-6
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about John the Baptizer's work?
\tqe Luke wanted to show us that John began the work of getting people's hearts ready to hear and obey Jesus' message, just as the angel (1:16-17) and the Holy Spirit (1:76-79) had told Zechariah that John would do.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 3.1-2
\bttq What kind of work did the men Tiberius (Caesar), Pontius Pilate, his brother Philip and Lysanias all do?
\tqe They were all high government officials [in areas where the Romans had authority]. (1)
\an (Note: Tiberius was the highest Roman official and lived in Rome. The other men were officials under him in the regions around Jerusalem.)
\bttq What kind of work did the men Annas and Caiaphas do?
\tqe They were high priests [in Jerusalem]. (2)
\bttq What happened to John during the time when all those men were the leaders of the people?
\tqe God told John to start his work. (2)
\bttq Where was John living when God told him to start his special work?
\tqe He was living in an uninhabited area/the wilderness/desert. (2)
\tqref LUK 3.3-6
\bttq What did John do in all the area around the Jordan River?
\an He preached that people were to repent and then be baptized. (3)
\an (Note: The key terms "preach" and "repent" are discussed here, but "baptize" will be checked below in vs. 7.)
\bttq If a person preaches in your/a village, what does he do?
\tqe (Accept any answer. Probable answers:
\tqe He teaches more of the parts of the Bible to the people who believe the talk about Jesus.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He harangues the believers to behave better than they have been doing.)
\an (Note: Neither of these two actions is what the Bible called preaching. When one of the above answers is given, if at all possible, the translator should use other words appropriate to the action found in the verse in the GNT and not automatically use the church word for "preach".)
\bttq What do you think that John actually did in those places when he "preached"?
\tqe Key Term Check: John spoke out with authority to tell some news (that God had sent the savior he had promised to them). In this verse, he also was telling the people how they could respond appropriately to that news.
\an (Note: In the GNT, preaching was always done to people who had not yet heard the message. In English translations, three different Greek words are all translated "preach". In this verse the Greek word focuses on the aspect of telling with authority.)
\bttq What does a person do when he repents?
\tqe Key Term Check: He deliberately stops doing the sinful ways that please himself and changes to doing those ways which please God and are right in God's sight. (See "repent" in KBT.)
\bttq Why did people repent?
\tqe They wanted God to forgive/remove their sins. (3)
\bttq What had the prophet Isaiah written about this many years before John and Luke were born?
\tqe He had written that someone would preach in the wilderness that people were to get ready to accept the one whom God would send to save them. (4-6)
\bttq How were those people to get ready for this?
\tqe They were to correct/change their lives from living in bad ways to living in ways that pleased God. (They were to do whatever was necessary to get rid of their bad ways, like men straighten and level bad places in a path/road.) (4-5)
\bttq Why did Luke quote these words which the prophet Isaiah had written?
\tqe He wanted to show the readers that John was doing what Isaiah said that someone would do before the savior arrived. (2b-4)

\rf Luke 3:7-20 John the Baptizer preached his message to the people.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 3.7-20
\bttq What did Luke write about in these verses?
\tqe He wrote about what John said to different groups of people, especially to those who came to him in order for him to baptize them.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 3.7-9
\bttq How many people came to where John was staying in that uninhabited area/wilderness/desert?
\tqe Crowds of people. (7)
\bttq Why did so many people go to see John?
\tqe They wanted John to baptize them. (7)
\bttq What do you think that John did with the people when he baptized them?
\tqe Key Term Check: He did something so that water washed over the people either by putting them down under the water or by putting water over the top of them, probably the first way (Mark 1:9-10). (See "baptize, baptism" in KBT.)
\bttq With what did John compare these people?
\tqe He said they were [like] a group of poisonous snakes. (7)
\bttq What does it mean in your language if one person calls another person a (poisonous) snake?
\an (Note: The translation should reflect an insulting put-down by John. Some bad characteristic of poisonous snakes should be implied, such as their being sly, deceiving, or deadly. It should not be anything that is regarded as speaking well of a person.)
\bttq What were those people doing which reminded John of snakes?
\tqe [By coming to be baptized, they thought that they were tricking John/God. They wanted him to think that they had already repented of their sins, but they had not repented.] They hoped that in this way they could escape God being angry about their sins and ready to punish them as they deserved. (7)
\bttq John called the people a bunch of young snakes who had descended from other snakes. Who do you think those people were, who showed/taught them to act like they were doing?
\tqe They were their parents, -OR-
\tqe the leaders of the Jews, -OR-
\tqe even the devil, who is the chief evil spirit. (7)
\an (Note: In other places in the Bible, the devil used the form of a snake to deceive people [Gen. 3 and 2 Cor. 11:3]. Jesus later said that the devil was their father, and called him the Father of Lies [John 8:44].)
\bttq If those people did not want God to punish them for their sins, John told them one thing they must do and one thing they must not do. What were those two things?
\tqe He said that their actions must show that they really had repented/changed. (8a)
\tqe Also, they must not think that, because they were descendants of Abraham, God would not punish them for their sins. (8b)
\bttq Why did John say that they must not trust in their being descendants of Abraham to keep God from punishing them?
\tqe He said that, if God only wanted a large number of descendants from Abraham, he could change ordinary stones into more descendants. [That meant that God did not need those particular people for any reason.] (8)
\bttq In verse 9 John used the picture language of a tree and its fruit, an ax at the tree's roots and a fire. What do you think these things represent?
\tqe The tree represents a person.
\tqe The tree's good fruit represents activities the person does which please God.
\tqe People use an ax to cut down fruit trees which do not produce good fruit. John said the ax was already close to the tree roots. When roots are cut, the tree's life is totally ended. Likewise, God is ready to punish/destroy a person because he/she is bad. That will be the end of that person's life.
\tqe The fire represents how that unproductive tree will be destroyed, which suggests the fire of hell for such a person.
\bttq Which type of people did John picture as being ready to burn in hell?
\tqe They were the people who had not repented,
\tqe and/or they were trusting in their ancestry (who their ancestors were) to save them. (See 3:8.)
\tqref LUK 3.10-14
\bttq What did John tell the people they should do to show that they had truly repented?
\tqe They should be ready to share their clothing and food with those who have [little or] none. (11)
\bttq What did John tell the men who collected taxes that they should do to show that they had truly repented?
\tqe They should not collect more money from people than the true amount of tax the people owed [to the Roman government]. (13)
\bttq What did John tell the soldiers they should do?
\tqe They should be satisfied with their pay. That is, they should not physically force anyone to give them money. (14)
\tqe They also should not say that if the person would not give them money, they would falsely accuse that person in court [so that person would get into trouble or be put in the jail]. (14)
\tqref LUK 3.15-18
\bttq What do you think that the Jewish people were waiting for and thinking might be happening?
\tqe They were waiting for the Christ/Messiah to come and set them free from their troubles. (15)
\bttq What were all the people thinking about John in this regard?
\tqe They were seriously wondering if John himself was the Christ. (15)
\bttq How did John answer them concerning whether or not he was the Christ/Messiah?
\tqe He himself was not the Christ/Messiah. The Christ/Messiah would have much greater power and authority than he himself had. (16-17)
\bttq How did John show that the Christ would do greater work than he himself was doing?
\tqe The Christ would baptize people with the Holy Spirit and fire, not just with water as John did.
\tqe John did not feel he even was important enough to be the servant who might assist Christ by untying his sandals. (16)
\tqe John pictured the Christ as having authority to save and to punish people. (He himself did not have such authority.) (17)
\bttq What do you think it means that Christ will baptize people with the Holy Spirit and with fire?
\tqe Those whom Christ causes to repent will receive his Holy Spirit into their hearts,
\tqe but Christ will throw those who do not repent into the fires of hell to destroy them. (17)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The Christ would cause people who repent to come under the influence of God's Holy Spirit. The Spirit would get rid of all that was not good in their lives just as a fire does with grass and sticks. (17)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Baptism with water is only an outward, ritual cleaning to show what we want to happen in our inner being. The Christ will truly clean/cleanse one's inner being by means of his Holy Spirit and remove impurities as fire does. (16-17)
\bttq What is the work of the winnowing fork in the picture language John used?
\tqe People use it to separate all the rubbish from the good grain. (17)
\bttq What, do you think, are the good things and the bad things that the Christ will be separating?
\tqe Christ will separate the good people from the bad people. Those people who repent and believe in him are good. Christ will separate them from those people who do not repent.
\bttq What do you think will happen to those people whom he calls good?
\tqe He will gather them [into heaven] where he wants to keep them, as a farmer gathers the wheat and stores it in a safe place. (17)
\bttq What do you think will happen to those people whom he calls bad?
\tqe They will be burned up/destroyed in the never-ending fires [of hell], as a farmer burns the rubbish parts of the wheat and grass. (17)
\bttq In verse 18 Luke wrote that John kept on urging/strongly requesting [the people to repent of their sins] and that he preached the Good News to them. If people will be punished in the fires of hell, that does not sound like good news. What was the good news that John preached?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Good News was that the Christ, the one whom God had promised would come to save his people, was already among them. If they repented and prepared their hearts to accept the savior, God would not throw them into the fires of hell. (See "gospel" in KBT.)
\an (Note: If the language of the translation allows for it, try to use the terminology you have here for "good news" back in 1:19 and 2:10 also. Those two references are a bit more general, but they do still apply to the Good News of the savior having come.)
\tqe Key Term Check: The words "preached the Good News" in English translations are actually only one word in Greek. The word literally means, "he Good News-ed". The focus is on what he preached, not how he did it.  See the discussion above at 3:3.
\tqref LUK 3.19-20
\bttq Why did John rebuke Herod, the king?
\tqe Herod had done something bad with his brother's wife, Herodias, as well as having done other bad actions. (19)
\bttq What other bad action did Herod do then?
\tqe He [sent men and had them] put John into prison. (20)

\bttq Who do you think baptized Jesus?
\tqe John the Baptizer did (Matt. 3:13-15; Mark 1:9).
\bttq Did John baptize Jesus before he was in the prison, or after being there?
\tqe John did it before he was in the prison.
\an (Note: John died while he was in the prison [Mark 6:14-29]. Try to show in either verse 20 or 21 that the activities in 3:21-22 happened before the activities in vs. 20.
\an You may want to put verses 19-20 into one section with verses 21-22. Number these verses together as 19-22, and mention Jesus' baptism [from 21-22] first, followed by Herod putting John in prison [from 19-20].)
\bttq What happened while John baptized Jesus and then Jesus was praying?
\tqe [God] opened heaven/the sky (21) and the Holy Spirit came down upon him in a bodily form like a dove. Also, God spoke [to Jesus] from heaven. (22)
\bttq Do Luke's words sound as though this was a vision Jesus saw, or do the words sound as though this really happened?
\tqe The words, "in a bodily form," show that it really happened. (22) (See John 1:32-34.)

\rf Luke 3:23-38 These were the ancestors of Jesus.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 3.23-38
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about Jesus' ancestors?
\tqe He showed the Jews (and us) that Jesus was the Messiah that the prophets had said would come, because he had the same ancestors, such as David and Abraham, as the prophets had said the Messiah would have.
\tqe He showed us that Jesus was a true human being like us.

\bttq How old was Jesus when he began his work of preaching the Good News?
\tqe He was about 30 years old. (23)
\bttq Does this listing sound like the way other people who speak your language would tell you about their own list of ancestors?
\tqe (It should. This listing should follow the traditional way of listing one's ancestors.)
\bttq Whom did people think was the father of Jesus?
\tqe Joseph. (23)
\bttq Whom did Luke name as the true/original ancestor of Jesus?
\tqe God. (38)
\bttq Which names in the list do you remember from other parts of the Bible?

\tqe Jacob and his father Isaac [34], or
\tqe Isaac and his father Abraham [34], or
\tqe Shem and his father Noah [36], or

\bttq Luke wrote about the time when the devil came to Jesus. What do you think that we are to learn from that?
\tqe The devil tried to make Jesus disobey God, but Jesus would not disobey.
\tqe If Jesus had obeyed the devil, he would have been as sinful as we are. Then he could not have been the one to save all of us who sin.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus had human feelings just as we do. When he had not eaten for forty days, he was very hungry. The devil tried to make Jesus obey him instead of obeying God, but Jesus did not obey the devil.

\bttq Why did Jesus go into an uninhabited area/into the wilderness/desert?
\tqe The Holy Spirit caused him to go there. (1)
\bttq Who is the devil whom Luke wrote about here?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is the chief of the evil spirits, the enemy of God and God's people. (See "Satan" in KBT.)
\bttq What did the devil try to do with Jesus there?
\tqe He tempted Jesus [to sin]./He tried to make Jesus obey him and disobey God. (2)
\bttq What does it mean to tempt another person?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that one person tries to make the other obey him to do something which disobeys higher authorities, such as parents, the government, or God. (2)
\bttq Why was Jesus hungry?
\tqe He had not eaten during the forty days he had been staying there. (2)
\bttq How did the devil try to use this hunger of Jesus to make Jesus obey him?
\tqe He told Jesus to prove that he was the son of God by changing a stone into food. (3)
\bttq How did Jesus respond to him?
\tqe He spoke words which were written [by Moses in the book of God's Words]. He said that eating food is not the only or most important thing in life. (4)  [He did not obey the devil.]
\tqref LUK 4.5-8
\bttq What did the devil show to Jesus from a high place?
\tqe He showed him all the nations of the world at one time. (5)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the devil took Jesus to a high place?
\tqe He wanted to show Jesus how much authority/power he had over the whole world.
\tqe He hoped to entice Jesus to follow him.
\bttq How did the devil tempt Jesus when they looked at all those kingdoms/nations all over the world?
\tqe He said that if Jesus would worship him, he would give Jesus all authority [to rule] over the kingdoms/nations/people.
\tqe He would also give Jesus all the glory/honor that a person would receive because he had that authority. (5-7)
\bttq What do you think that a person does when he worships another person?
\tqe Key Term Check: He shows great honor and deep respect for the other person. He acts as though that person has more authority or strength or wisdom or goodness or beauty than any other human, and so is like God. (See L&N entry 53.14 and those at 53.53-64.)
\bttq Who do you think gave the devil the authority over the kingdoms/nations/people?
\tqe God did before the devil disobeyed God and God made him leave heaven.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe God had given that authority to the first people, Adam and his wife, Eve. But they obeyed the devil, rather than what God had told them to do. In that way they gave that authority to the devil.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe No one had given that authority to the devil. He lied about it to Jesus.
\bttq How did Jesus respond to the devil this time?
\tqe He spoke words which were written [by Moses in the book of God's Words]. He said that everyone is to worship and serve only the Lord [who is] God. (8)  [He did not obey the devil.]
\tqref LUK 4.9-13
\bttq How did the devil tempt Jesus the third time?
\tqe He said that Jesus should prove that he was the son of God by jumping off the highest point of the temple and falling to the ground. (He even partially quoted Psalm 91:11-12 to back up his dare.) (9)
\bttq How would this prove that Jesus was God's son?
\tqe Because God would tell his angels to watch over him, he would not hurt himself. (9)
\bttq How did Jesus respond to him this time?
\tqe He spoke words which were written [by Moses in the book of God's Words]. He said that no one is to tempt/test God. (12)  [He did not obey the devil.]
\bttq What do you think it means to test God? (12)
\tqe A person tries to cause God to do what that person wants to happen. The person wants God to feel as though he (God) must do this action in order to show that he is more powerful than the problem the person created.
\bttq Jesus' answers stopped the devil from tempting him more. Where did Jesus always get his answers?
\tqe The answers were all in God's Word [which men had written down long ago]. (4, 8, 12)
\bttq What did the devil do after Jesus would not obey him those three times?
\tqe He left Jesus and waited for another time to try again later. (13)

\rf Luke 4:14-30 The people of Nazareth rejected Jesus.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 4.14-30
\bttq What can we learn from what Luke wrote about the ways that people responded to Jesus' preaching?
\tqe People who lived all over Galilee [province] heard about him (14) and praised him (15). From the words of Isaiah (21), the people could see that Jesus was that person whom God had promised to send [as the savior]. However, the people of his hometown would not accept him as sent by God (24). This was because they thought of him as being only a local man whom they had seen grow up (22).
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 4.14-15
\bttq Back in verse 1 when Jesus went into the wilderness/desert, he was led by the Holy Spirit and had all the power of the Holy Spirit. What did Luke write about this at the time Jesus left that uninhabited area?
\tqe He returned to Galilee [province] completely guided by the Holy Spirit's power (just as when he went into the desert). (14)
\bttq What did Jesus do there in Galilee [province]?
\tqe He taught in the people's synagogues around the area. (15)
\an (Note: There is a strong implication that Jesus also had been doing miracles, such as healing people. That is implied from the words "power of the Spirit" and "news about him spread", as well as Jesus later stating that the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in the work he was doing.)
\bttq What do you think a synagogue was?
\tqe Key Term Check: A synagogue was a building which the Jews built in order to gather for hearing someone read and teach from the Word of God and where they could worship him. Many Jews lived too far away from the temple in Jerusalem to walk there regularly for worship, so they built a synagogue in each village for that purpose. (See "synagogue" in KBT.)
\bttq How did the people around Galilee [province] respond to Jesus?
\tqe The news about him spread all around (14).
\tqe All those who heard him teach praised him (15).
\tqref LUK 4.16-17
\bttq Why did Jesus go into the synagogue in Nazareth?
\tqe That was the village where [Mary and Joseph] had raised him.
\tqe He customarily went there every Sabbath Day [to worship God]. (16)
\bttq What do you think makes a particular day be the Sabbath Day?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is the seventh day of the week, Saturday, the day on which God rested from his work of creating the world. He told people to honor him on that day by resting from their work/by not working. The Jews used that day to meet together to worship God. (See "Sabbath" in KBT.)
\bttq Why did Jesus stand up in the synagogue?
\tqe It was the customary way for a person to show that he wanted to read [God's Word]. (16)
\bttq Take a piece of paper and show me what Jesus did in order to get ready to read.
\tqe (The person who is answering these questions may have to roll up the piece of paper first before unrolling it and holding it at a proper distance for reading from it. Jewish Scripture writings happen to be rolled side-to-side, not top-to-bottom, but that is not the key part of the action you want to see happen.)
\an (Note: A footnote or glossary entry may be needed to indicate that long ago people wrote on long pieces of paper or thin animal skin which they kept safe by rolling each one around a wooden rod. In order to read the words, the paper or skin had to be unrolled to find the place where one was to begin reading.)
\bttq Which part of God's Word did Jesus open?
\tqe He opened/unrolled the part that the prophet Isaiah had written. (17)
\bttq After Jesus had opened the scroll/book/papers, what did he do? (17-18)
\tqe He read part of what Isaiah had written there.
\tqref LUK 4.18-19
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Isaiah referring when he wrote "me" in these two verses?
\tqe (Isaiah was not speaking about himself. He was referring to a special Servant of the Lord whom God would send to the Jews. That special person would say these words to the Jews. The Jews already understood that servant would be the Messiah whom God had promised to send to them. We know from verse 21 that this special person was Jesus himself, but Isaiah did not know Jesus' name when he wrote these words.)
\an (Note: The translator may need make this explicit at the end of verse 17 in the introduction to the quote, such as, "... where it is written about the special Servant of the Lord, ...").
\bttq What did Isaiah say this special person would do?
\tqe He was to tell/preach the Good News [that God's plan to save them was taking place right then] to the poor people. (18b)
\tqe He was to proclaim [with authority]/preach to the people whose lives were as if they had been captured [by the devil and their own sins] that they could be free [of those things]. (18c)
\tqe He was to proclaim [with authority]/preach to the blind people that they could see again. (18c)
\tqe He was to free those who had been treated unfairly. (18d)
\tqe He was to proclaim [with authority]/preach that the time when the Lord would show kindness to his people [had come]. (19)
\an (Note: Has the reference to the Good News been translated in the same way here (4:18b) as it was in 3:18? It should be clearly referring to the same thing both there and here.)
\bttq How would that special person know he was supposed to do that work?
\tqe God's Spirit had or would anoint him by coming on/to him in a special way (18a).
\bttq What does it mean to anoint someone?
\tqe Key Term Check: Someone having great authority appoints another person to do a special kind of work on his behalf. That person with authority usually shows this by pouring or rubbing an oil or ointment onto the other person's head. In the Bible times people most often used olive oil to appoint and dedicate a new prophet, priest or king. The focus here is on the appointing function, not on the pouring on of oil. (See "anoint" in KBT.)
\bttq How would that person be able to do all those difficult things?
\tqe God's Spirit would make him able to do those things. (18)
\tqref LUK 4.20-22
\bttq When Jesus had finished reading part of Isaiah's words written on the paper/scroll, what did he do with that scroll?
\tqe He rolled it up and gave it back to the man who looked after the writings. (20)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that everyone there was watching him?
\tqe Because he sat down (as was the custom for a teacher to do), they now expected him to teach them about that text [or even to do some of those things he had read about]. (20)
\bttq What did Jesus say about those words which he had read from the book by Isaiah?
\tqe They were now coming true as they heard him speak them [because he was the one about whom Isaiah had written, the one whom God had anointed/chosen to do these things]. (21) (See "Scripture" in KBT.)
\bttq How did the people think of him at first?
\tqe They thought and spoke well of him and were amazed at his very good way of speaking/the wonderful things he said. (22)
\bttq Why were they amazed by his speaking ability?
\tqe They knew him as [the carpenter] Joseph's son, [just a local boy with no special schooling]. (22) (They did not know any normal reason why he should know so much about God's Word.)
\tqref LUK 4.23-27
\bttq What does this proverb, "Doctor, first make yourself well!", mean in regard to Jesus?
\tqe Since he had done miracles in Capernaum [and other places in the general area], he must do the same things right there in his hometown. This would show everyone that he really was the person about whom the prophet Isaiah had written.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe If a person who claimed to be a doctor was able to cure himself, then what he claimed would be true. In the same way, if Jesus could do miracles, then what he claimed [as being sent by God] would also be true. (23)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus' response to them means?
\tqe A prophet is not accepted by the people in his hometown because they know him and think of him as the same kind of person as themselves. They think he is not able to teach them anything they do not already know about God.
\tqe Jesus knew that these people did not accept that he was a prophet. He also knew that they did not accept that he was the Christ. Therefore, they would not be able to accept or believe what he said or did right there in front of them.
\bttq What caused the Jews to suffer long ago when Elijah lived in Israel?
\tqe There was no rain for 3 1/2 years. That caused a severe famine. (25)
\bttq There were many widows in Israel at that time who had great trouble finding food. To whom did God send Elijah?
\tqe He sent Elijah to a widow who lived in the town of Zarephath. Zarephath was near the city of Sidon [outside the land of Israel]. (26)
\bttq There were many people sick with leprosy/bad skin disease in Israel when Elisha lived. Whom did God bring to Elisha to be made well?
\tqe Naaman, a man from the country of Syria. (27)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus was talking about when he said that Naaman was made "clean"?
\tqe Key Term Check: He was talking about Naaman having clear skin again after he was well.
\tqe He was also talking about the kind of cleanness God required before a person could be allowed into the public worship or allowed to live with his family again. (See "clean" in KBT.)
\an (Note: If a very general word like "clean" is being used in the translation, make sure it does not refer only to removing external things like dirt or general illness from the body.)
\an (Note: This is the same Greek word which was used in 2:22 when Mary needed to become "clean" again following childbirth. However, the language of the translation may have separate names for each of these situations due to the male-female distinction or due to blood being involved in one case and not in the other. The words in the translation must be appropriate to each of these references.)
\bttq How do the two examples from the Old Testament scripture show that what Jesus was saying about prophets was true?
\tqe The people of Israel did not accept/believe two of their greatest prophets, Elijah and Elisha. Their own people did not accept them as men who spoke for God, so God used them to do his work among other people, some non-Jews who did believe them. (25-27)
\bttq Thinking about these two examples, if the Nazareth people would not accept Jesus as the Christ, what do you think that he would do?
\tqe He would go to other places, (as Elijah and Elisha had done,) where the people would accept him as a prophet/the Christ.
\tqref LUK 4.28-30
\bttq What was the people's response when they heard Jesus say those things in verses 23-27?
\tqe They were full of anger/furious. (28)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that they were so angry about what Jesus had said?
\tqe They knew that he was implying that they were not believing, just as the Jews had done in the time when Elijah and Elisha were prophets.
\tqe They felt that he was rejecting them and would go to other places to teach God's word and do great things [by God's power] among people who would accept him. He might even go to people who were not Jews.
\bttq What did those people do to Jesus?
\tqe They [angrily] removed him [from the synagogue and on] out of their town. They took/led him to an edge of the hill on which their town was built, intending to throw him over that edge/cliff [to kill him]. (29)
\an (Note: The town was not on the top of the hill. It was on the side of a hill which has some steep edges at the top. People think that is where the townspeople took Jesus.)
\bttq Why were they not able to do what they intended to do?
\tqe Because Jesus walked through the middle of the crowd and went on his way, the people did not get to push him over the edge.(30)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that he was able to do that?
\tqe  God's Spirit and power helped him.

\bttq What did the people in the Capernaum synagogue think when they heard and saw what Jesus did there?
\tqe They were greatly astounded/astonished. (32, 36)
\tqe They talked about it among themselves (36) and with others (37).
\bttq What happened that caused them to think like that?
\tqe Jesus spoke with so much authority and power that even demons/evil spirits obeyed what he told them to do. (32, 36)  (They realized that God must be helping him do those things.)
\dh Details
\bttq What did Jesus do on the Sabbath Day when he was in the town of Capernaum?
\tqe He was teaching [God's Word to] the people in the synagogue. (31)
\bttq Why did a man in the synagogue shout loudly at Jesus?
\tqe He had a demon, that is, an unclean/evil spirit, in him. (33)
\bttq What do the people who speak your language say are the characteristics/signs to know a spirit is a demon/an evil spirit?
\tqe Key Term Check: A demon is a spirit that only does evil things and tries to cause trouble for people, especially those who want to obey God's Word. The demon obeys Satan and opposes what God has said. (Notice that Luke called the same spirit by both names in this verse.)
\tqe (See "evil spirit, unclean spirit, demon" and "unclean, defiled, impure, uncleanness" in KBT.)
\bttq What did the demon in this man know about Jesus?
\tqe He knew that Jesus was a man from the town of Nazareth. (34)
\tqe He knew that Jesus had power and authority to destroy/get rid of him [and other spirits who were in the man]. (34)
\tqe He knew that Jesus was the holy one who had come from God. (34)
\bttq How did Jesus make the demon leave the man?
\tqe He sternly commanded/rebuked the spirit that it must stop what it was saying and doing, and now leave, and it did. (35)
\bttq Why were the people so astonished?
\tqe Jesus not only taught with authority, but even evil spirits obeyed his commands. (36)
\bttq Who heard about these things which Jesus had done there in Capernaum?
\tqe People who lived in all the areas around Capernaum heard about these things. (37)

\bttq Why did Luke write about Jesus leaving Capernaum to go to other cities?
\tqe Jesus said that the real reason he came down to earth was to preach the Good News that God wanted to rule and reign in each person's life. (43)

\bttq What did the people at Simon's house ask Jesus to do?
\tqe Someone asked him to help [by healing] Simon's mother-in-law who was suffering with a high fever. (38)
\bttq How did Jesus make her well?
\tqe Standing/Bending over her, he sternly commanded the sickness to leave her. (39)
\bttq How do we know that she was well quickly?
\tqe She immediately got up and served [food to] the people there. (39)
\bttq What happened later in that day as the sun was setting?
\tqe People brought everyone who was sick in some way to Jesus. [They wanted Jesus to heal the sick people.] (40)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the people waited until the sun was setting?
\tqe The Jewish laws did not permit people to travel or carry things on the Sabbath Day. A day ended when the sun set, and the new day began. Being a new day, people could then come and bring those who were sick.
\an (Note: The translator may want to create a footnote or glossary entry to explain this.)
\bttq How did Jesus make them well again?
\tqe He laid his hands on each one of them and healed them. (40)
\bttq What did the demons do when they came out of many people?
\tqe They cried out that Jesus was the son of God. (41a)
\bttq What else did they know about Jesus?
\tqe They knew that he was the Christ/Messiah. (41b)
\bttq What did Jesus strongly warn/sternly command those demons/evil spirits not to do?
\tqe He strongly warned/sternly commanded them not to speak about this again. (41)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus forbid them to speak anything more?
\tqe He did not want people to think that he (Jesus) was associated with the evil spirits.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He wanted people to recognize God's power and authority in his words and actions
\tqe and then realize that he was the Christ, just as God had promised them.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Many Jews thought that the Messiah would set them free from the Roman government, not from sin, so they would misunderstand such words from the spirits.)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He did not want the Jewish leaders to turn against him and end his ministry before he had done everything that God had sent him to do.

\bttq Where did Jesus go the next day at daybreak?
\tqe He went out [from the town] to a place where he could be alone. (42)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the people were looking for him?
\tqe They wanted him to stay there, [perhaps to heal people when they were sick or to do other miracles]. (42)  (They may have thought that he had already left their town.)
\bttq Why did Jesus not stay there, but went to other towns, even as far away as the synagogues in Judea province?
\tqe God had sent him [down to earth] to tell/preach the Good News about the kingdom of God. (43, 44)
\tqe Key Term Check: The two words which are often translated "preach" in English translations are both here in one context. Verse 43 refers to the content of Jesus' message. Verse 44 refers to how he presented that Good News message, doing it "with authority".
\bttq What is the kingdom of God?
\tqe Key Term Check: God wants to rule over every person and reign in each one's heart and life as a king rules over the people who live in his country. The people in a kingdom submit to the king's rule, obeying his laws. God was establishing his kingship through his son, Jesus, whom he sent to the earth as the Messiah/the Christ he had promised to send. (See "kingdom of God" in KBT.)

\tqe He and the other men had fished all night, but had caught nothing. (5)
\bttq Why would Simon try again to catch fish?
\tqe He respected Jesus, who had told him to do it. (5)
\bttq What happened when they obeyed Jesus' words?
\tqe They caught so many fish that their nets began to tear/break [from the weight]. (6)
\bttq How were they able to pull in those nets full of fish?
\tqe They motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. (7)
\bttq Why were both the boats about to sink?
\tqe The many fish filled both boats and were so heavy that the boats sat very low in the water. (7)

\bttq Who is this man named Peter?
\tqe He is Simon. It is another name for him. (8)
\an (Note: You may wish to have a footnote or glossary entry which indicates that Simon was also called Peter in the Greek language [John 1:40-42]. Simon was his Hebrew name.)
\bttq Show me what you think that Simon did when he "fell down at Jesus' knees".
\tqe (The translation assistant should kneel in front of someone or something which represents Jesus' legs. We do not know if Simon bowed his head or not, but that was a sign of honor to the person who was standing or sitting.)
\bttq Why did Simon fall down at Jesus' knees and tell him to go away from him?
\tqe He had seen Jesus use God's power and was astonished by it. Now he shows his submission to Jesus. He knew that he was a person who sinned [and that Jesus did not sin]. Simon probably felt unworthy to have one sent by God right there helping him. (8-9)
\bttq Other people also were astonished by this large number of fish they had caught. Who were they?
\tqe They included Simon's companions as well as his partners, James and John (who were sons of the man named Zebedee). (9-10)
\bttq What did Jesus say in response to Simon's words?
\tqe "Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men." (10)
\bttq What do you think that Simon would do to "catch men"?
\tqe He would not grab people with his hands or his fishing net. This is picture/figurative language. Simon would gather people, both men and women, by encouraging them to become believers in/followers of Jesus in God's kingdom.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus said that Simon should not have been afraid of him or his power? (10)
\tqe They would be working together for the same purpose, not as enemies. Jesus had used his power to help, not to hurt or frighten anyone.
\bttq How did those men get ready to "catch men"?
\tqe They pulled their boats up on the shore, left everything there and followed Jesus. (11)
\tqe (Note: The meaning of "to follow Jesus" here includes both walking behind Jesus away from the boats at the lake and learning from him as they went everywhere together.)
\bttq How did the men catching so many fish helped them decide to follow Jesus? What do you think?
\tqe Simon saw that Jesus had real power and authority when he spoke or did something.
\tqe He recognized that it was power from God that he, as a normal, sinful human being, did not have. (8)
\tqe The men would learn more about that power and authority [and about Jesus' message] as they went around with him and listened to him teach.

\dh Details
\tqref LUK 5.12-13
\bttq How did Jesus and the man sick with leprosy/the bad skin disease meet?
\tqe Jesus was in the same town as the man. The man saw him there. (12)
\bttq What did the man do when he saw Jesus?
\tqe He quickly bowed low, putting his [knees and his] face to the ground [in front of Jesus] and pleaded with/appealed to Jesus to heal him so he would be [physically and ritually] clean. (12)
\bttq This man talked to Jesus as if he was not sure about something. Was he not sure that Jesus wanted to heal him or was he not sure that Jesus had enough power to heal him?
\tqe He was not sure that Jesus wanted to heal him. He knew Jesus had enough power. (12)
\bttq What do you think that the man was thinking about when he said, "Make me clean"?
\tqe Key Term Check: He was talking both about having clear skin again after he became well
\an and about becoming ritually clean. That means that the priests would allow him to once again be in the public worship and in the presence of God and to live with his family. (See 4:27, above.)
\bttq How did Jesus make the man well again?
\tqe He reached out and touched/put his hand on the sick man and told him he was healed. (13)
\an (Note: If a person allowed another who was sick with leprosy to be near him or to touch him, that was a culturally bad thing. It meant that the new person also was ritually unclean for a set amount of time. Therefore, no one wanted to touch a person with leprosy, but Jesus felt compassion for the man. The translator may want to have a glossary entry about the Jews' laws and taboos concerning leprosy [see Lev. 13-14].)
\tqref LUK 5.14-16
\bttq What was the man to do after Jesus healed him?
\tqe He was to go show his healed skin to a priest and then offer the sacrifices which Moses had commanded for a person who was healed of leprosy. (14)
\bttq What result did Jesus intend when he told the man to go to the priest?
\tqe He wanted the people/the priests to know for sure that the man was totally healed [and safe to be near]. (14)
\tqe (It would also show that Jesus followed/obeyed the Laws of Moses and told others to do the same.)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus commanded the man not to tell anyone about this?
\tqe He did not want people to become excited only about the things he did to help people.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He did not want the man to interact with other people before a priest declared him [ritually] clean.
\an (Note: If the person who is answering these questions already knows a lot about events in the four gospels, he may give one of the answers below. These answers are still true and acceptable, but they are not found in Luke's gospel up to this point.)
\an He did not want the people or the priests to think that he disregarded the Laws of Moses.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He did not want the priests to hear of the miracle before the man arrived. If they were hostile toward Jesus, they might decide not to say that the man was cured or ritually clean.

\bttq After Jesus healed that man, how did people respond?

\dh Details
\tqref LUK 5.17-20
\bttq Who had come to hear Jesus teach?
\tqe Pharisees and teachers of the Law had come from many places. (17)
\bttq What do you know about these two groups of men called the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Pharisees were a group of Jewish religious leaders who also were very much like a political party. They followed the teaching of the experts in interpreting the Scriptures (who are often called scribes, or teachers of the Law). After those teachers of the Law had decided how a Jew was to live in order to please God, the Pharisees tried to live that way. They were very proud of themselves and thought that they were better than all the other people who did not live as they did.
\tqe The teachers of the Law were men who had authority to copy the writings of the Old Testament writers. They became the teachers and interpreters of the Old Testament Scriptures, especially the laws of God written down by Moses. Because of that work of writing, those men were called scribes. (See "Pharisee" and "scribe, teacher of the law" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Luke write about the power of God?
\tqe It was there with/in Jesus and available for him to heal [the sick people]. (17)
\bttq Why were some men coming, carrying another man on a mat/stretcher?
\tqe The man on the mat was paralyzed, and they believed that Jesus could heal him. (18, 20)
\bttq Tell me about the sickness of the man on the mat/stretcher.
\tqe The sick man could not move his legs and, perhaps, not his arms. It was as if those parts were dead. He could not walk or stand, so his friends carried him to Jesus.
\bttq When they came to the house, what did they try hard to do?
\tqe They tried hard to carry the sick man inside and lay him in front of Jesus. (18)
\bttq Why were they not able to do that?
\tqe There were many people in the house/in their way. (19)
\bttq What did they do in order to put the sick man in front of Jesus?
\tqe They went up onto the [flat] roof,
\tqe [removed some roofing material/tiles from] over the place where Jesus was
\tqe and lowered the mat on which the sick man lay. (19)
\bttq Why did Jesus decide to forgive the sick man's sins?
\tqe He saw [all the hard work the men had done to put the sick man in front of him, and knew] that they believed/had faith that he could heal the man. (20)
\bttq What was that faith which the men had?
\tqe The men trusted and were confident that something was true, even when it could not be seen. They trusted and were confident that, by the power of God, Jesus was able to heal their friend. (See "faith" in KBT in the "believe" entry.)
\tqref LUK 5.21-24
\bttq Why were the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law/scribes upset when Jesus said that he had forgiven the sick man's sins?
\tqe They did not believe that Jesus was God's son. Because only God can forgive sins, when Jesus forgave the man's sins, they wrongly thought that he was blaspheming God/pretending to be like God. Anyone who claimed to be God or to have God's authority was blaspheming God. (21)
\bttq What do you think that a person does when he blasphemes God?
\tqe Key Term Check: He claims to be equal with God in some way.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He speaks evil against God. He insults God and defames his name and character so that others will not honor or respect him.
\tqe (God had said that people should kill such a person [Lev. 24:16]).
\bttq How is it, do you think, that Jesus knew their thoughts? (22)
\tqe He was God's son and the Lord God's power was present with him (17).
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus implied that they should not have thought such things? (22)
\tqe The things that he had already taught and done should have proven to them that he had come from God and that God had given him authority both to forgive sins and to heal the sick.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They came expecting to hear Jesus teach God's Word clearly and do some miracles. Since he could only do those things by God's power, he could forgive sins by that same power, too.
\bttq What do you think is the answer to Jesus' question about whether it is easier to forgive sins or to heal a person who is paralyzed? (23)
\tqe Neither action is possible unless you are God. If Jesus could do one, he must be God, so he could do the other by using that same power.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe If you say you have power to forgive someone's sins, it may be just empty words, because no one can see whether it is true or not. However, if you say you have power to heal someone, everyone will see whether that happens or not. In that way, healing someone is harder to do, because everyone will see whether you are lying or not.
\bttq Whom was Jesus talking about when he spoke about the Son of Man?
\tqe He was speaking about himself. (24)
\tqe Key Term Check: This is a title used in the Old Testament in Dan. 7:13-14. Daniel was referring to a human figure who, nevertheless, is a being in heaven. God gave him authority to be the leader of God's people on earth. The teachers of the Law knew that this title referred to the Messiah. Jesus applied this title to himself. See "Son of Man" in KBT.
\bttq Why did Jesus tell the sick man to get up and leave?
\tqe He said that to the sick man in order that the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law would know that he had power from God to heal the man. Then they would know that he also had authority (from God/as God's son) to forgive sins. (24)
\tqref LUK 5.25-26
\bttq How did the people there know that Jesus had healed the man?
\tqe He stood up in front of them, took up his mat/bedding and went home praising God. (25)
\bttq What did those people think and do when they saw the man do that?
\tqe They all could hardly believe what they were seeing, and it caused them to have great respect for God and to praise him. They realized that they had seen unusual things happen right there in front of them. (26)

\rf Luke 5:27-32 Jesus called Levi to follow him.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 5.27-32
\bttq When Jesus called Levi to follow him, how did Levi respond?
\tqe He left everything [related to his government work] and followed Jesus. He even hosted a banquet/feast in Jesus' honor. (27-29)
\bttq When Jesus ate food with many other people at Levi's house, how did the Pharisees and teachers of the Law/scribes respond?
\tqe They complained to his disciples. (30)
\bttq Why did Jesus come to this earth?
\tqe He came to call/invite people who know they sin to repent [of their sins]. (32)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 5.27-28
\bttq What work did Levi do?
\tqe He collected tax money [for the Roman government]. (27)
\an (Note: You may wish to have a footnote or glossary entry which indicates Levi was also called Matthew in the Greek language [Matt. 9:9-13]. Levi was his Hebrew name.)
\bttq Where was Levi when Jesus spoke to him?
\tqe He was sitting in a government office collecting taxes. (27)
\bttq What did Jesus ask Levi to do?
\tqe He asked Levi to follow him [and learn from him as they went everywhere together]. (27)
\bttq What did Levi do to show that he already believed in Jesus?
\tqe He got up, left everything [related to his work] and went with Jesus. (28)
\tqref LUK 5.29-32
\bttq How did Levi honor Jesus?
\tqe He made a great banquet/feast for Jesus. (29)
\bttq What other groups of people were also at this feast?
\tqe There was a large crowd of other men who collected taxes (29), some Pharisees and teachers of the Law/scribes (30), Jesus' disciples (30) and others (29) [whom the Pharisees and teachers of the Law regarded as sinners (30) ].
\bttq What kind of a person is a disciple?
\tqe Key Term Check: A disciple is a person who spends much time learning from someone who is wise. Usually the student follows the teacher everywhere he goes, listening to and discussing with the teacher everything he or she says. The disciple is like an apprentice, but is not learning craft skills. (See "disciple" in KBT.)
\bttq Who were Jesus' disciples at this time?
\tqe Luke has only written about Simon Peter, James, John (vs. 11) and now Levi.
\an (Note: There probably were many other people who followed Jesus and may be included here. However, we only know the names of those twelve whom he called his apostles [Luke 6:12-16], and two others who were later considered to replace Judas as an apostle [Acts 1:21-23].)
\bttq Why did the Pharisees and teachers of the Law/scribes complain to the disciples?
\tqe Jesus and his disciples were eating with the tax collectors and other people whom the Pharisees regarded as sinners. They were people who did not follow all the ways Pharisees said that were necessary to fully please God. (30)
\bttq What do you think is the meaning of Jesus' illustration about people who need a doctor?
\tqe Sick people know they need help, so they do whatever the doctor tells them to do to get well again. In the same way, people who know they are sinners, know they need someone to help them become right in God's sight again.
\tqe Jesus said that he came to help the people who [know they] sin to repent. The people who already think they are well or righteous do not look for, and do not want, any help. (31-32)
\bttq Jesus used the picture language of people who know they are sick and people who think they are well. To whom, do you think, was he referring?
\tqe The tax collectors, disciples and those whom the Pharisees called sinners knew that they needed Jesus to help them.
\tqe Generally, the Pharisees and teachers of the Law/scribes were the ones who thought that they were good/righteous. Therefore, they thought that they did not need Jesus to forgive them.

\rf Luke 5:33-39 Some people asked Jesus about the reason that his disciples did not fast.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 5.33-39
\bttq Jesus' disciples treated fasting and praying differently than John's disciples and the followers of the Pharisees did. How did Jesus show the reason for that difference?
\tqe He told them stories to explain/illustrate the reason. (34-35, 36, 37-39)
\bttq What did Jesus show in his picture language was the reason for this difference?
\an (Note: The more parts of the answer which someone gives, the better the answer, but even one part will be an acceptable answer. Not every part must be understood from this one reading.)
\tqe Jesus was saying that his disciples were celebrating something new, that is, the son of God was among them. This meant having new ways of responding to God and his Word.
\tqe The old ways were no longer adequate, [even though they had been right and good in their time and had served well].
\tqe These new ways, however, would not just blend in and match the old, but must totally replace them.
\bttq What did Jesus imply that the response of some people would be to him?
\bttq -OR-
\bttq How did Jesus expect some people to respond to him?
\tqe They would reject the new ways [of relating to God which he, Jesus, lived and taught,] and stay with their old ways [as explained by the Pharisees and teachers of the Law]. (39)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 5.33-35
\bttq How were Jesus' disciples different from the disciples of John and the Pharisees?
\tqe The disciples of John and of the Pharisees often fasted and prayed. Jesus' disciples did not. (33)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "fasting" discussed at 2:37.
\bttq What comparisons did Jesus make when he used the picture language about a wedding?
\tqe He compared his disciples to the friends of the bridegroom and compared himself to the bridegroom. (34-35)
\bttq In what way, do you think, did Jesus' comparison answer their question about why his disciples did not fast?
\tqe Jesus' disciples did not fast at that time because they were happy that Jesus was with them (34). Later, when he had been taken away from them [by his enemies], they would fast [because they would be sad] (35).
\tqref LUK 5.36
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that it is not good to patch/mend an old piece of clothing with a piece cut from a new piece of clothing?
\tqe The new one is ruined and the old one looks strange and mismatched.
\bttq What comparison, do you think, was Jesus making when he used the picture language/parable about the new clothing and the old clothing and a patch?
\tqe The new clothing represented what Jesus was teaching about a person's relationship with God.
\tqe The old clothing represented the ways the religious teachers had taught the people to relate to God in the past.
\tqe The patch was only a small piece of the new way. It did not really make things better.
\bttq What do you think were ways that Jesus wanted the people to change?
\tqe If the people wanted to be in a right relationship with God, they must follow what Jesus taught, and not just try to improve what they were already trying to do.
\bttq If the people who speak your language use picture language/parables, tell me one of those stories and then tell me its meaning.
\tqe Key Term Check: A parable shows its meaning indirectly by using picture language to make a comparison. The parts of the comparison are generally not explained. The listeners themselves must think much about the meaning hidden in each part of the picture language. Jesus taught spiritual truths in this story form. (See "parable" in KBT.)
\tqref LUK 5.37-39
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that it is not good to put new wine into old wineskins?
\tqe New wine will [ferment and swell and] burst the old wineskin [which is no longer flexible] and will spill out onto the ground. That will ruin both the wine and the wineskin. Neither one will have any value. (37)
\bttq What comparison, do you think, was Jesus making when he used the picture language about the new wine and the old wineskin?
\tqe The new wine represented Jesus' new teaching [about a person's relationship with God].
\tqe The old wineskin represented the way the people had been relating to God in the past.
\tqe If people tried to fit the new ways into the old patterns [as taught by the Pharisees and traditions], that would not work. The old way, then, was no longer useful and the value of the new way would be lost, too.
\bttq What do you think were ways that Jesus wanted the people to change?
\tqe (He wanted them to change in the same ways as he had talked about in the parable with the old and the new clothes.) If the people wanted to be in a right relationship with God, they must follow what Jesus taught, and not just try to improve what they were already trying to do, such as fasting.

\rf Luke 6:1-11 Jesus' authority was greater than the laws about the Sabbath Day.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.1-11
\bttq Why did the Pharisees criticize Jesus and his disciples for picking grain?
\tqe They thought that Jesus and his disciples were disobeying the Laws [of Moses] about [not working on] the Sabbath Day. (2, 7)
\bttq What did Jesus tell them about the Sabbath Day?
\tqe He said that he, the Son of Man, was Lord over it, that is, he had authority [from God] to say what could be done on the Sabbath Day. (5)
\tqe Also, he implied [with the example from God's Word about David and his companions] that God permitted people to do good, helpful things on the Sabbath Day when there was a special need. (3-4, 9)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 6.1-5
\bttq Where was Jesus walking one Sabbath Day?
\tqe He was going through grain fields. (1)
\bttq What kind of a place do you think a grain field is?
\tqe It is a field/garden where grass crops like wheat or barley are planted to raise the seeds for food.
\bttq What did Jesus' disciples do as they walked there?
\tqe They picked some heads of the grain, rubbed them around in their hands [to remove the husks] and ate the kernels. (1)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that they did that?
\tqe They were probably hungry. (3-4)
\an (Note: They were not stealing the grain. The Law of Moses allowed them to take some grain to eat as they walked along [Deut. 23:25].)
\bttq What do you think that the Pharisees were thinking about when they criticized Jesus and his disciples?
\tqe They regarded what the disciples did as being work, [like harvesting grain or gathering food]. People were not permitted by the Law [of Moses] to do any kind of work activity on the Sabbath Day. (2)
\bttq What did David and his companions once do when they were hungry and had no food?
\tqe They entered [the grounds of] the house of God,
\tqe received [from a priest] the bread which only the priests were permitted to eat [after they had offered a new set of fresh bread to God],
\tqe and ate it [even though they were not priests]. (4)
\bttq Why was that food/bread special and only for the priests to eat?
\tqe The priests previously had given it to God, setting it out [on a special table] for him. (4)
\bttq Does it sound to you as though Jesus was saying that David and his men had done something wrong?
\tqe (It should not sound that way. Rather, Jesus was using this story about David as an example that it is more important to meet a need than to obey the rules of religion.)
\bttq Who was this "Son of Man" whom Jesus said had authority to decide what was permitted on the Sabbath Day?
\tqe Jesus himself was the Son of Man. (See 5:24.)
\tqref LUK 6.6-8
\bttq What was wrong with one man in the synagogue where Jesus was teaching?
\tqe He had a shriveled/atrophied right hand. (6)
\bttq Why were the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law/scribes carefully watching Jesus?
\tqe If Jesus healed that man on the Sabbath Day, they would have a good reason to accuse him of working. The Law [of Moses] did not permit anyone to work on the Sabbath Day. (7) (Then they could punish him or, at least, tell people that he was not a good teacher of God's Word.)
\bttq Why did Jesus tell the man with the shriveled hand to stand up in front of everyone else?
\tqe He knew what those men were thinking, so he wanted everyone to clearly see him heal the man. (8)
\tqref LUK 6.9-11
\bttq The Pharisees did not answer Jesus' question about which choice should be made. Which of those choices do you think that people should choose?
\tqe People should choose to do good, which may save someone's life. (9)
\bttq How did the man's hand become perfect again?
\tqe Jesus told him to stretch it out straight. When the man obeyed Jesus, his bad hand became completely well. (10)
\bttq How did the Pharisees respond when Jesus told them these things and then he healed the man?
\tqe They were furiously mad/full of anger at him and began discussing what they could do to [kill] him. (11)
\an (Note: See Matt. 12:14 and Mark 3:6, where the Pharisees stated clearly what they intended to do.)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law were so angry at Jesus?
\tqe He neither interpreted the rules, nor obeyed them in the way that they had taught people to obey them.  -OR-
\tqe He implied that, if people followed their rules, they might do something evil or even destroy someone's life. (9)  -OR-
\tqe He was making them appear to be foolish in front of many people.

\rf Luke 6:12-16 Jesus chose twelve men and appointed them as his apostles.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.12-16
\bttq Why did Jesus spend a whole night praying to God?
\tqe A large group of disciples followed Jesus. He wanted [God to help him] to carefully choose a few men out of that large group to become his apostles. (12-13)
\dh Details
\bttq Do you think that Jesus went alone to pray or that other men went with him?
\tqe He probably went alone. Luke wrote that Jesus went into the hills to pray and that he wanted to choose some special workers. (He probably would not have asked any other person to join him at that time.) (12)
\bttq How do you know God had helped him choose the right men?
\tqe He immediately chose them in front of the other people who followed him. (13)
\bttq How many men did he choose for this special work?
\tqe Twelve men. (13)
\bttq What was the special name Jesus gave this group of twelve men?
\tqe He designated them as his apostles. // He named them apostles. (13)
\bttq What do you think the difference was between the work an apostle would do and the work a disciple would do?
\tqe Key Term Check: An apostle was sent with full authority from the one who had sent him to speak or act in his place. A disciple was really only a student who followed his teacher around. He had no authority to represent the teacher. (See "apostle" and "disciple" in KBT.)
\bttq Tell me about the two men named Simon.
\tqe Jesus gave the name Peter to one Simon. He was the brother of Andrew. (14)
\tqe The other Simon was known as the Zealot. (15)
\bttq What do you think a "Zealot" was?
\tqe Jews who really wanted their people and their country to be free from the control and rules of the Roman government were called Zealots. They felt strongly that they should be independent.
\an (Note: If the word is not already translated by a descriptive phrase, the translator may want to explain the word in a footnote or glossary item.)
\bttq Tell me about the two men named James.
\tqe One was a son of Zebedee and the brother of John (see 5:10). They were partners with Simon in the fishing business. (14)
\tqe The other James was the son of a man named Alphaeus. (15)
\bttq Tell me about the two men named Judas.
\tqe One was the son of a man named James. (15)
\tqe The other Judas was Judas Iscariot, who [later] became a traitor [to Jesus]/a betrayer [of Jesus]. (16)
\bttq What do you think it means for a person to be a traitor/betrayer?
\tqe Key Term Check: He acts like a good friend to you or your group, but then he helps your enemies do something bad to hurt you/your group.

\tqe as well as people from the region beside the sea where the towns of Tyre and Sidon were. (17)
\bttq Why were those people waiting for Jesus?
\tqe They had come to hear him [teach God's Word]
\tqe and to have him heal them of their diseases. (18)
\bttq What happened to some of those people?
\tqe Those people who were troubled by evil spirits were healed. (18)
\tqe Those people who touched Jesus were all healed by his power (flowing out from him,) [into them]. (19)
\tqref LUK 6.20-23
\bttq What are some of the characteristics of those whom Jesus says are happy/feel blessed by God?
\tqe They are poor (20), hungry, weeping (21) and hated (that is, excluded, insulted and defamed) by others because they associate with Jesus (22). (That is, they focus on God.)
\an (Note: The Greek word which is translated in these verses as "blessed" is not the same word which Luke used back in 1:42, 1:64, and 2:28 when Elizabeth, Zechariah, and Simeon each blessed someone. The word Luke used here refers to inner happiness, not outward happiness.)
\bttq Why would the disciples know they should expect this kind of trouble/bad treatment?
\tqe The [peoples'] forefathers had treated the prophets, [who also had focused their lives on God,] the same way. (23)
\bttq Why are the people who have these troubles called happy/blessed by God?
\tqe God rules and reigns in their lives, that is, they live under God's authority and direction. (20)
\tqe Their hunger/needs/desires [to know God better and to please him] will be met. (21a)
\tqe Their crying will become laughter. (21b)

\bttq What are some of the characteristics of those people who should expect God to cause horrible things to happen to them?
\tqe They are rich (24), well fed, enjoying this present life (25) and ones about whom people say good things (26).
\bttq Why will they suffer punishment from God, and not blessings?
\tqe They have focused their lives on becoming rich and have already enjoyed many pleasures in this life. (24)
\tqe They have focused their lives on eating well, but will still hunger/have a need [for real satisfaction]. That hunger will not be met. (25a)
\tqe They have focused their lives on entertaining themselves, [not on what pleased God]. (25b)

\bttq How should a person who follows Jesus treat his enemies?
\tqe He should love his enemies. (27)
\an (Note: The person who answers may also talk about doing good to them (27), blessing them and praying for them (28). If he included all these, you should skip the next question. If he did not include these things, please ask the next question.)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek language has several words which are translated "love" in English. The word used here means a gracious, outgoing, active interest in the welfare of another person. John used the same word to explain how much God loves us [John 3:16; 1 John 4:9-11. Jesus used the word to talk about loving God and loving one's neighbor as one loves himself [Mark 12:30-31]. Paul used the word to tell how a husband should act toward his wife [Eph. 5:25]. We should love our enemies the same as God loves us and the same as we love anyone else, including our wives and God. The translator must have good reasons if he/she has used a different word for love in this verse than he/she would use in those other contexts. See "love" in KBT.)
\bttq How should one show love for his enemies?
\tqe Do good to those who hate you (27),
\tqe ask God to bless those who curse you (28a)
\tqe and pray for those who are cruel to you (28b).
\an If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn [so he can hit] the other one also. (29a)
\an If someone takes something of yours, such as your coat, do not stop him from taking [other things, such as] your shirt. (29b)
\an If someone asks you to give him something, give it and don't ask for it back. (30)
\bttq What do you think that a person will say or do if he is cursing you? (28)
\tqe Key Term Check: He wants evil and suffering to come into your life, so he asks spirit beings, either God or an evil spirit, to cause you injury or trouble. This is the exact opposite of the meaning of "blessing". (See "curse" in KBT in the "bless, blessed, blessing" entry.)
\bttq What did Jesus say is a good way to remember how we are to show love to such people?
\tqe We should do for other people what we want them to do for us. (31)
\tqref LUK 6.32-34
\bttq Why did Jesus not praise people who show love or do good only to those who have already done the same for them?
\tqe Even people who do not try to obey God, do that. (32-33)
\bttq What if you lend something to another person knowing that he will repay you?
\tqe That, too, is not any different from what any non-Christian would do. You will not receive any special credit from God for doing that. (34)
\tqref LUK 6.35-36
\bttq Jesus said that we are to love our enemies, do good to them (27) and lend things to them without expecting to get anything back (30). If we do like that, what will be the result?
\tqe [God] will greatly reward us
\tqe and [people will know that] we are children of the Most High [God]. (35)
\bttq Why will we be regarded as his children for doing like that?
\tqe We will be doing as our heavenly Father, God, does. He is kind and compassionate, even to the people who are ungrateful and wicked. (35-36)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.37-42
\bttq What did Jesus say about people who judge the actions and motives of others?
\tqe He said that they are like blind people trying to show other blind people the right way (39).
\tqe They are hypocrites because they have the same problems in even greater amounts, but do not pay attention to them (42). (They are no help to anyone.)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 6.37-38
\bttq What does it mean to judge someone?
\tqe Key Term Check: A person sees or hears something about that other person, evaluates it, and decides how he will act towards that other person. Usually the person who judges assumes a position of authority [and superiority] over the one he is judging. (See "judge, judgment" in KBT.)
\bttq In what ways can one show God's mercy to another person?
\tqe Jesus said that we are not to judge the other person['s motives] or condemn him/her, that is, we are not to decide what is an appropriate punishment for that person. We should forgive that person (37) and be generous to them (38). That will show God's mercy.
\bttq If we do not judge others, but forgive them, how will God act toward us?
\tqe He will not judge or condemn us, but will forgive us (37). He will be generous to us (to the same degree that we have been generous to others). He will give us even more, in return, than we might have expected (38).
\bttq What did Jesus say that tells you that God will be generous to us?
\tqe He spoke about a good/full measure, about pressing the things down [in the container], about shaking the things together and about extra things spilling over [the edge of the container]. (38)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the person selling the grain (6:38) would pour it into the buyer's lap/onto the buyer's clothing?
\tqe The seller did that in order that the buyer could carry the grain away. (Also, the grain would be too much to carry in cupped hands.)
\an (Note: In the Jewish culture of Jesus' time the people wore loose-fitting clothing. Some folds of extra cloth were spread wide at times to be used to carry such things as grain. See TN for Luke 6:38.)
\tqref LUK 6.39-40
\bttq What did Jesus say will happen if a blind man follows another blind man?
\tqe Neither man will see a hole, so they both will fall into it. (39)
\bttq What other picture language did Jesus use to show us how we are to know what to do?
\tqe He talked about a student learning all that he is able to learn from his teacher. Then he would be like his teacher. (40)
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he talked about a blind man? (39)
\tqe The blind man represents any one who does not know what is the right thing to do. If we follow such a person, we will be just like them. That is, we will not know what is right and will probably get hurt, besides.
\an (Note: Jesus may have been referring to Jewish leaders who did not accept that God had sent him to be the savior. Whoever followed their leading would also not believe in him.)
\bttq To what teacher and students, do you think, might Jesus have been referring? (40)
\tqe He was referring to himself as the good teacher. People who do what he teaches are his students, his disciples. Those people will be like him.
\bttq First look at what Jesus taught his disciples in verses 20-40. Then tell me four or more ways which Jesus said that his disciples could be like him. (NOTE: All of these items should be clear in the translation, but do not expect anyone to find more than six quickly. Four items will be adequate.)
\tqe The disciple/student will want to know God better. (21a)
\tqe He will be hated, insulted, and rejected [by people who oppose God]. (22)
\tqe He will love his enemies [as well as his friends]. (27a, 35)
\tqe He will do good to those who hate him. (27b, 35)

\bttq What did Jesus say in his picture language about a speck of sawdust and an entire plank?
\tqe A person with a plank in his own eye sees a speck of sawdust/wheat chaff in another person's eye and offers help, not even noticing his own bigger problem. (41)
\tqe Key Term Check: Jesus said that the man with the small thing in his eye was the other man's "brother". If the translation uses the kin term for brother, ask about whom one calls his "brother" in that culture. If that word refers only to people who are one's blood relatives, suggest using a term with a wider meaning. The Greek word for "brother" included a wider sense of referring to other men with whom one interacted regularly, such as one's neighbor. See "the brothers" in KBT in the "disciple" entry.
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted us to learn from this picture language?
\tqe We do not notice, or try to correct, our own big problems or very bad actions. Instead, we are quick to see other people's small problems and wrong actions and tell them what to do, as though we are better than they are.
\bttq What did Jesus call a person who acts like that?
\tqe He called that person a hypocrite. (42)
\bttq What might a village person have done that would cause other people to call him/her a hypocrite?
\tqe Key Term Check: Such a person pretends to believe or do what other people will approve or for which they would praise him. He does not act because he really believes it is right or good.
\bttq What did Jesus say one must do before he is able to help another person with his problem?
\tqe He must get rid of his own big problem before he can help another person with his/her small problem. (42)

\rf Luke 6:43-45 Jesus told a parable about recognizing a tree by its fruit.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.43-45
\bttq How did Jesus compare trees and their fruit to people?
\tqe We can know the true inner character of a person by his/her words and actions (45), just as we can tell the quality of a tree by looking at its fruit (43-44). // In the same way that fruit can only be as good as the tree which produces it (43-44), a person's words and actions will reflect what is in his/her heart (45).
\dh Details
\bttq What did Jesus say about trees and their fruit in this parable?
\tqe He said that good trees produce good fruit and bad trees have bad fruit. Therefore, one can know whether a tree is good or bad just by looking at its fruit. (43-44)
\tqe Also, the specific kind of fruit depends on the kind of tree on which it is growing. (44)
\bttq What did he say about people and their character and behavior/actions?
\tqe He said that good people have good qualities in their hearts and those are seen in their behavior. Evil people have evil thoughts in their hearts and those are seen in their evil behavior. A person's words show the kind of thoughts which are in his/her heart. (45)

\rf Luke 6:46-49 Jesus told a parable about the way in which two men built houses.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.46-49
\bttq How did Jesus use the example of the base/foundation for a house to show us how people ought to respond to Jesus' teaching?
\tqe Those who set their way of living [and their faith] on a good, firm basis which will last, do so when they not only hear the words of Jesus, but also obey them.
\dh Details
\bttq Why was Jesus upset by people calling him by the respectful title "Lord"?
\tqe They talked as though they respected him as their teacher, but they did not show it by obeying what he taught. (46)
\bttq Who did Jesus say is like a man who builds his house on a firm/strong base/foundation?
\tqe He is the person who comes to Jesus, hears his teaching, and then does what Jesus said. (47)
\bttq What happens when troubles come to a person who has that strong base/foundation for his life?
\tqe He stands firm [in his faith]. // He is not moved [from his strong belief in Jesus]. (48)
\bttq Who did Jesus say is like a man who does not build his house on a firm/strong base/foundation?
\tqe He is the person who hears Jesus' teaching, but does not do what he said. (49)
\bttq What happens when troubles come to such a house or such a person?
\tqe The house does not stand firm. It collapses and is totally destroyed. [Likewise, the troubles destroy a person who does not base his life on Jesus. He will suffer in hell forever].(49)

\bttq What did Jesus do to help a Roman army officer?
\tqe He healed his servant/slave who was sick and dying [without going directly to the man]. (6, 10)
\bttq Why did the Jewish elders want Jesus to help the Roman army officer?
\tqe They said that the officer loved their Jewish people
\tqe and that he even had helped much to build a synagogue for them. (4-5)
\bttq What was the real reason that Jesus helped the army officer, even though he was not a Jew?
\tqe Jesus knew that the officer had great faith in him [to heal his servant]. (9)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 7.1-6
\bttq What happened that caused a Roman army officer to send a message to Jesus?
\tqe The servant/slave of the army officer was sick and about to die (2), and the officer heard about Jesus [either that he healed the sick, or that he had returned to Capernaum] (3).
\tqe Key Term Check: See 1:38 above for the meaning of "servant" and "slave".
\bttq Why was this important man in the army even thinking about a servant/slave?
\tqe He loved/respected/valued this young man. (2)
\bttq Whom did this army officer send with his message to Jesus?
\tqe He sent some elders of the Jews. (3)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the Roman army officer sent those men and not other Romans or himself?
\tqe Perhaps he thought that Jesus would listen to elders of his own Jewish people more than to someone who was not a Jew.
\bttq What message did this army officer send to Jesus?
\tqe He wanted Jesus to come and heal his servant. (3)
\bttq How do you know that those Jewish leaders also wanted Jesus to help this Roman man?
\tqe The words "kept on urging"/"earnestly asked"/"strongly requested" mean that those Jewish leaders wanted Jesus to help the man. They said that he was worthy [in their thinking] to have Jesus help him. (4)
\tqref LUK 7.6-8
\bttq Whom did this army officer send with another message to Jesus?
\tqe He sent some of his friends. (6b)
\bttq Why did the army officer himself not want to inconvenience/cause any problem for Jesus?
\tqe He did not feel worthy/good enough to either speak with Jesus or to have Jesus come inside his home. (6b-7)
\an (Note: He also may not have wanted to cause a cultural problem for Jesus, because he knew that it was taboo for a Jew to enter the house of a non-Jew.)
\bttq How did the army officer expect Jesus to heal the servant/slave if Jesus did not go inside the house where that sick man was?
\tqe He believed that Jesus needed only to speak [the words of healing from wherever he was] and the sick man would be well again. (7)
\bttq How did the army officer know that Jesus could heal his servant just by saying that the man was to become well?
\tqe He knew how authority worked. // He was under some higher authority and others were under his authority. When someone with authority spoke, that command was carried out. (8)
\an (Note: By saying this, he showed that he believed that Jesus had been given authority by God over sickness. When Jesus spoke, the sickness would have to end/leave.)
\tqref LUK 7.9-10
\bttq How did Jesus react to the words of the Roman army officer?
\tqe He was amazed and told the crowd of people that he had not found [any other person with] great faith like that, not even among the people of Israel. (9) (He knew that this kind of strong faith did not normally happen even among the Jews who had God's Word and who had Jesus himself in their midst.)
\bttq What does it mean that someone believes/has faith in another person?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that he believes what that person told him and that he trusts that person to do just as he said that he would do. (See "faith" in KBT in the "believe" entry. Also see 5:22, above.)
\bttq How do we know that Jesus healed the army officer's servant/slave?
\tqe We read in verse 10 that when the friends of the army officer returned to his house, they found that the servant/slave was already well. (10)

\bttq Who was with Jesus when he approached the town of Nain?
\tqe His disciples and a large crowd of other people were with him. (11)
\bttq What did they all see happening as they came near the gate/entranceway in the town wall? (12)
\tqe Men were carrying out a dead person [on a stretcher], and many townspeople were with them.
\an (Note: If the language requires that the manner of carrying a dead person be named, use the appropriate cultural name for such a stretcher or platform. The translation must not imply that the men carried the corpse in their bare hands, even if it was wrapped in cloth. That was taboo for a Jew.)
\bttq Where do you think that the men were taking the corpse? (12)
\tqe They were going to bury it away from where the people lived.
\bttq Who was the dead person?
\tqe He was the only son of a widow. (12)
\bttq What do you think made this especially sad for the woman?
\tqe Being a widow, she needed a son to care for/support her.
\tqe Also, a son was needed to carry on the family lineage and name.
\bttq Why did Jesus tell the widow, "Do not cry"?
\tqe He felt compassion for her [and would take away the problem that was causing her to cry]. (13)
\tqref LUK 7.14-15
\bttq What happened that caused the men carrying the coffin/bier to stop walking and stand still?
\tqe Jesus had come up to them and put his hand on the coffin/bier. (14)
\bttq To whom did Jesus then speak?
\tqe He spoke to the [dead] young man. (14)
\bttq The young man was dead. How, do you think, was he able to hear Jesus speak to him?
\tqe Jesus first made him alive again, then the young man heard Jesus' words.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus' power made the young man alive again through speaking the words.
\bttq How did the widow and the others with her know her son was alive again?
\tqe He sat up, as Jesus had told him to do, and he began talking. (15)
\bttq What do you think it means in 7:15 that "Jesus gave him back to his mother"?
\tqe Jesus put him back under his mother's care.
\an (Note: The young man owed his life to Jesus. In wanting to show his never-ending thankfulness to Jesus, the young man might have followed the cultural practice of being like a slave to the one who had saved him. Jesus released the young man from that sense of debt and "gave him back to his mother.")
\an -OR-
\an When the woman's son died, he "left" his mother. When Jesus made the young man alive again, it was as if Jesus was giving a gift to the mother.

\bttq How did they now regard Jesus?
\tqe They realized that Jesus was a great prophet now living among them
\tqe and that God [had come and] was helping his people [Israel] through the things which Jesus did. (16)
\an (Note: If the translation refers to God "visiting" his people, ask what that means when someone who speaks that language does that action in the village. If the primary meaning is to stay with someone you have not seen for a while, suggest a change in terms. The original Greek word had much more focus on coming to care for or look after someone else. The word strongly implies that the visitor takes a continuous responsibility for the one/ones being visited.)
\bttq How do you know that the people liked what Jesus had done?
\tqe They praised God/gave glory to God [for causing it] (16)

\rf Luke 7:18-35 Jesus described his ministry in relation to that of John the Baptizer.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 7.18-35
\bttq How did Jesus' ministry relate to/compare with John's ministry?
\tqe John prepared the way for Jesus and now Jesus had arrived. John had done his part, just as [the prophet Malachi] had written [Mal. 3:1] (27).
\tqe Now Jesus was ministering to needy people [just as the prophet Isaiah had said that the one sent from God would do], adding to, and finishing, [in unexpected ways] what John had started (21-23).
\bttq How did people respond to what Jesus said about himself and John? His answer appeared to be different from what John and others had expected.
\tqe Some people [had repented and] had John baptize them. They were the same ones who now were recognizing that God was working through Jesus [and were ready to obey him]. (29) (They believed that God was doing through Jesus' ministry what they had expected through John's ministry.)
\tqe The Pharisees and the experts in the Law [of Moses] had rejected what John had told them, so they were not ready/able to accept what Jesus now taught them, either. (30)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 7.18-23
\bttq John [the Baptizer] learned about Jesus' ministry through his own disciples and had not gone to see for himself. What do you think was the reason for that?
\tqe King Herod had put John in prison earlier (see 3:20), so he could not go see for himself.
\bttq What was the important question that John wanted to ask Jesus?
\tqe Was Jesus the person whom God had said would come [as the Messiah], or were they to wait for someone else [to be the Messiah]? (19, 20)
\bttq What had John's disciples seen and heard that should be a clear answer to him?
\tqe They had seen Jesus heal many who were sick or had evil spirits in them. (21)
\tqe He also had made the people who were blind to see (21, 22);
\tqe [he had made] those who were lame to walk (22);
\tqe [he had] healed those who had leprosy/bad skin disease, making [them] ritually clean; (22)
\an (Note: The meaning of the Greek verb katharizw includes both physical cleanness and ritual cleanness. [See L&N entry 23.137.] A different word is used in verse 21 to refer only to being healed. The translation may need to use two verbs to cover all the meaning here.) (See the discussion at 5:12-16 about leprosy and people being made clean.)
\tqe [he had made] those who were deaf to hear [22];
\tqe [he had] raised those who were dead [ to be alive again] [22];
\tqe and he was telling/preaching the Good News to the poor people (22). (The Good News was that God had sent the Messiah to save them and that God wanted to rule and reign in their hearts.)
\bttq In what way, do you think, were all these things a clear answer to John's question?
\tqe They all showed that Jesus was God who had come among the people to help them (as people had been saying all over the country [17] ).
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They all showed that Jesus had power from God [just as Jesus had read in the Nazareth synagogue from the prophet Isaiah's writings (See Luke 4:17-21) ].
\bttq What kind of person did Jesus say would be truly happy when he thought about all the things that Jesus was doing?
\tqe That person is one who does not stop believing that Jesus was the Messiah whom God had sent into the world. (23)
\an (Note: Although verse 23 is worded as a general truth and applies to everyone, Jesus was specifically directing this statement to John, just the same as verse 22. If the person answering these questions has not heard or read much about John's ministry in his/her own language, he will probably not realize that John expected the Messiah to do things differently from the way Jesus was doing them. John expected that Jesus would talk more of God's judgment, as John had done, not of God's love. That is the reason that John sent his disciples to ask the important question in verse 19.)
\tqref LUK 7.24-28
\bttq Why had people gone into the uninhabited area/wilderness/desert to see John?
\tqe They went because he was a prophet, even more than an ordinary prophet. (24-26)
\an (Note: There had not been any prophet from God for over 400 years, so many people went to see John out of curiosity, as well.)
\bttq In what ways was John not like a reed in the wind? (24)
\tqe Reeds are very ordinary plants like stiff grass, which people commonly see as the wind blows them back and forth.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Wind blows and pushes reeds back and forth in various directions, but John always was strong to preach the same message about repenting. He did not change his message because someone, such as King Herod, did not like to hear it (see 3:19-20).
\bttq In what ways was John not like a man in fine clothes? (25)
\tqe People who wear expensive clothes live in large, beautiful, expensive homes, such as a king does. John lived in the desert (see 1:80b).
\an (Note: We also know that John wore clothes made from rough camel hair and ate things which he found in the wilderness/desert [Mark 1:6].)
\bttq What was the purpose of John's ministry?
\tqe God had sent him as a messenger. John was to tell people to prepare their hearts/thoughts [to accept Jesus as the one whom God had sent to save them]. (27)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus said that John was greater than anyone else ever born? (28)
\tqe He had the important work of preparing the way for Jesus, the savior of all mankind.
\bttq What do you think is a way in which whoever is least important in the kingdom of God is greater than John? (28)
\tqe John, the greatest one to announce that the kingdom of God had began, was not as great as the least important person who experiences the joy and blessings of Jesus having saved him and who now obeys God as he rules and reigns in that kingdom.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe John regarded himself as a very unworthy servant (see 3:16), but every one who believes that Jesus has saved him/her is a child of God. That is greater than being a servant.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe John was in the prison and did not live to see Jesus die for mankind's sins and be raised by God to live again. The least important person who knows that those things did take place and believes that is greater (that is, blessed more) than John.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe John understood the kingdom of God as focusing on God's final, great judgment of all the world and on the circumstances which surrounded the Jews. Jesus knew that the kingdom was something inside a person, something spiritual and eternal. The least important person who understands that as Jesus did is, therefore, greater than John.
\tqref LUK 7.29-35
\an (Note: The Greek text does not tell us whom the people had been "hearing".

If the vernacular translation follows this understanding, use only the first form of the question below.
\an However, the translators of the GW translation understand these two verses to be part of the words of Jesus, referring to people who heard John the Baptizer preach. If the vernacular translation follows this understanding, use only the second form of the question. The answer is still the same for either question.)
\bttq How did the people, including those who collected taxes, respond when they heard Jesus speak about John like this?
\bttq -OR-
\bttq How did the people, including those who collected taxes, respond when they heard John preach?
\tqe Since John had baptized them, they all acknowledged that God's plan was right. [Part of that plan had been that John had helped them to prepare their hearts for the ministry and teaching of Jesus.] (29)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They all agreed that God was just [in his judging their sins and in his claim on their lives], as they had previously shown by their having had John baptize them. (29)
\bttq How did the Pharisees and the experts in the Law of Moses respond when they heard Jesus speak of John like this/when they heard John speak like this?
\tqe They rejected/refused to accept God's purposes/plans for themselves [in Jesus' message], as they had already shown by refusing to have John baptize them. (30)
\bttq Whom did Jesus compare to little children?
\tqe The people alive at that time [who had seen and heard both John and Jesus]. (31)
\bttq In what ways had those people acted like little children?
\tqe They did not like it when someone was serious and did not join in their lighthearted fun,
\tqe Neither did they like it when someone was joyous, but they felt he should be more serious. (32)
\bttq To whom did Jesus refer as the one who had been serious, but the people had rejected him?
\tqe He referred to John the Baptizer. (33)
\bttq What did some people see John do that they did not like?
\tqe They did not like him because he did not eat [food] and drink [wine] as they did. (33)
\bttq What do you think those people meant when they said that John had a demon [in him]? (33)
\tqe The way John lived (his clothes, food, home and appearance) caused people to think a demon was living in him and telling him things. (That was not true, but if it was true, the people would be right to not obey John's message, even though he said that it was from God).
\bttq To whom did Jesus refer as the one who had been joyous, but the people had rejected him also?
\tqe He referred to the Son of Man, (that is, he referred to himself). (34)
\bttq What did some people see Jesus do that they did not like?
\tqe They did not like him because he ate and drank with tax collectors and others whom they regarded as sinners [that is, people whom they thought were socially and religiously unacceptable]. (34)
\bttq How could anyone know whether John's and Jesus' ministries were really part of God's wise plan or not?
\tqe Those people who obeyed what John and Jesus taught were the ones who lived according to God's will/wise plan for them, [not those people who rejected both John and Jesus]. (35)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The lives of those who followed the teaching of John and Jesus showed that this was the right/ correct way to be in the will of God. (35)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe People prove that God's will/wise plan is right when they live according to what John and Jesus taught, and God accepts them, [while he does not accept those people who reject what John and Jesus taught]. (35)

\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus allowed this woman, whom other people regarded as bad, to touch him and put perfume on him?
\tqe Jesus allowed her to do what she did in order to teach Simon that God forgives anyone who repents.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe She responded with great love for Jesus because she realized that she had sinned much and God had forgiven her. (The more people realize that they have sinned, the happier they are when God forgives them.) (47)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that he had forgiven this woman?
\tqe She believed/had faith [in Jesus as the one who saved her from sin]. (50)
\an (Note: If the person answers that she loved Jesus/God very much, so he forgave her, that is the wrong answer. The translator has misunderstood the meaning of verse 47. Adjust that verse when you discuss it below [7:44-47], then read the adjusted section of the translation and ask this Overview question again.)

\bttq What did Luke write about the woman who came to the Pharisee's house?
\tqe She was [regarded by the other people as] a sinner, that is, a person who had done many things which were obviously against the Law of Moses. (37)
\bttq Why did she come to the Pharisee's house?
\tqe She knew that Jesus was there to eat with the Pharisee. (36-37)
\bttq Knowing that, what did she do?
\tqe She brought a stone bottle of perfume. (37)
\tqe She stood weeping near Jesus' feet [which were stretched out behind him, as he reclined] (38),
\tqe wetting his feet with her tears (38).
\tqe Then she wiped his feet with her [long] hair (38),
\tqe repeatedly kissed them (38),
\tqe and then poured the perfume on them (38).
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek word which is translated "poured on" in verses 38 of the NIV is translated "anointed" twice in verse 46. It is the same Greek word that Luke used in 4:18, but here the focus is on the literal pouring, not the figurative use for appointing. See "anoint" in KBT.
\bttq In verses 38 and 45 we heard the words "she kissed his feet". What, do you think, was the woman actually doing?
\tqe Key Term Check: She touched or pressed her pursed lips on his feet as a sign of her affection and reverence/respect for him.
\an (Note: If the culture of the translation does not show affection or reverence with the kissing action, it is more important to keep that purpose clear, rather than worry about describing the exact action of the woman. In verse 45, Jesus referred to the kissing action as a sign of greeting, though not done to the feet. It would be best if one action could stand for both, as in Jesus' time, but that may not be possible.)
\bttq What did the Pharisee think about this woman?
\tqe He thought of her as a person who had sinned much [and everyone knew it]. (39)
\bttq What did the Pharisee think about Jesus because he did not forbid the woman to do this?
\tqe He thought that Jesus was not a prophet because he allowed a sinful person to do this for him. (The Pharisee expected that a true prophet would have knowledge from God about the woman's bad actions in the past.) (39)
\tqref LUK 7.40-43
\bttq What did Jesus do to help the Pharisee Simon understand the meaning of the woman's actions?
\tqe He told a parable about two men who owed another person money. (41-42)
\bttq Tell me the parable.
\tqe Two men owed money to another person. One owed much more than the other. However, neither man could repay that money, so the moneylender forgave each man his debt. (41-42)
\bttq Which man did Simon say would love the moneylender more than the other man did?
\tqe He said that it probably was the one who had the bigger debt canceled. (43)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that would be true?
\tqe The one who had been forgiven much would show it more than the person who had been forgiven less.
\tqref LUK 7.44-47
\bttq If Simon had been a good Jewish host, he would have done certain things when Jesus arrived. What things did Jesus say that Simon had not done for him?
\tqe Simon had not given any water to Jesus for [washing] his feet. (44)
\tqe He had not given Jesus a kiss [of traditional greeting]. (45)
\tqe He had not anointed Jesus' head with [olive] oil [to show hospitality]. (46)
\bttq Which person showed the greater love for Jesus, Simon or the woman?
\tqe Jesus indicated that the woman did.
\bttq On what basis could anyone know that the woman's many sins had already been forgiven by Jesus?
\tqe They could see that she loved [Jesus] very much, [as such a person might do]. (47)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he implied that Simon had been forgiven few sins?
\tqe Simon may have thought that he did not sin much, so he had not ask God to forgive him much. (Simon had not realized how much God had forgiven him, so his response of love was less than the woman's response.)
\tqref LUK 7.48-50
\bttq What did Jesus tell the woman about her sins?
\tqe They all had been forgiven [by him]. (48)
\bttq What was the reason that Jesus had forgiven her many sins?
\tqe She believed/had faith [that Jesus could save her and cause her to have a right relationship with God]. (50)
\bttq What do you think this peace is that Jesus said would be in/with the woman as she left him?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is peace which God gives to a person who has trusted Him/who has believed in His Son. This peace is a calm heart/spirit free from worry when we face God because he has already forgiven our sins. (See "peace" in KBT.)
\bttq When Jesus told the woman that her sins had been forgiven, what did the other people there think?
\tqe They knew that only God could forgive sins, so they thought that Jesus was taking the place of God [and should be punished (see 5:21) ]. (49)

\bttq Tell me what Jesus was doing at that time.
\tqe He traveled to many towns and villages preaching the Good News that the Kingdom of God [had already come/begun]. (1)
\an (Note: See 7:22 above, where "Good News" was last mentioned.)
\bttq Who traveled with him?
\tqe His twelve apostles/disciples traveled with him. (1)
\tqe Also with him were some women from whom Jesus had made evil spirits leave or whom he had healed of other diseases. (2)
\bttq How did Jesus and his disciples have enough money for the things they needed?
\tqe The women used some of their own money to help them. (3)

\rf Luke 8:4-15 Jesus told a parable about a man sowing seed in his field.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 8.4-15
\bttq What did Jesus teach the people by means of this story about seeds and different types of ground?
\tqe Different people believe God's message [about the savior] in differing amounts. Some do not want to believe it, others only believe a little bit, and others are ready to believe everything God has said. Only those people whose hearts are ready [to receive and obey Jesus' teaching] will experience the fruit/benefits/good things that will come from believing. (12-15)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 8.4-8
\bttq Tell me what happened to the seeds in the story Jesus told.
\tqe Some seeds fell on the path. [People and animals] walked on them and then birds ate them. (5)
\tqe Some seeds fell on rock. It came up, but withered because there was not enough water. (6)
\tqe Some seeds fell where thorns grew. The thorns grew [big] and choked the plants. (7)
\tqe Some seeds fell on good ground and produced very much/a hundred times as much new seed. (8)
\bttq How did the man plant that seed?
\tqe He scattered the seed over the top of the ground. (5)
\an (Note: If the people who will use this translation do not plant seed in this way, a footnote may be helpful to explain that scattering seed is appropriate in many cultures. The man was not being foolish when he scattered the seed.)
\bttq When Jesus finished telling the story he said that the people with ears should listen. Every person has ears. What do you think that he meant? (8)
\tqe He meant that everyone should pay attention [and think carefully about the hidden meaning].
\tqref LUK 8.9-10
\bttq Why did the disciples ask Jesus to explain the parable?
\tqe They did not understand the meaning of the picture language. (9)
\bttq What did Jesus say was hidden in this parable?
\tqe The secrets about the kingdom of God, that is, how God planned to save people and then rule and reign as the one who is most important in their lives. (10)
\bttq To whom would Jesus explain the meaning of the parable, and to whom would he not explain it?
\tqe He would explain it to the disciples, but not to the other people. (10)
\an (Note: The Greek word order shows that Jesus emphasized the contrast between the two groups of people. The pronoun which refers to the disciples was put first in its part of the sentence and the pronoun which refers to the other people was put first in the second part of the sentence. It says, "To you [God] has given ..., but to the rest [it is] in parables." If the translator is able to show a strong contrast between the two groups in the wording of his translation, it would be good to do that here.)
\bttq Why were Jesus' disciples able to understand the meaning after he explained it, but the other people did not understand?
\tqe Because the disciples believed that Jesus was God and they were following him and learning more about God, he caused/allowed them to understand. (10)
\bttq Other people also saw Jesus do miracles and heard him tell the good news from God. What do you think was the reason that they not understand what they saw and heard?
\tqe They did not believe that God had sent Jesus to be their savior. Therefore, God did not allow them to understand. They would not have followed God better, even if they had understood the meaning.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus quoted what the prophet Isaiah had written. He implied that the same situation was happening again. The Jews living at the time of Jesus did not want to pay attention to God's message just like their forefathers in the time of Isaiah had not paid attention to Isaiah's message from God. (Jesus also implied that the end result for those who did not believe that God had sent him would be the same as it had been for their unbelieving forefathers. Their cities would be destroyed and their people would be scattered. [See Isa. 6:9-12.])
\tqref LUK 8.11-15
\bttq What did the seed in the parable represent?
\tqe It was the Word of God/God's message [about saving us by means of Jesus]. (11)
\bttq What did Jesus say that the different types of ground represented?
\tqe They were the people who heard/listened/paid attention [to God's message].
\tqe -AND/OR-
\tqe They are the people who hear/listen/pay attention [to God's message]. (12-15)
\bttq What happened to the different listeners?
\tqe Some heard God's message, but the people did not pay attention. Then the devil took what they had heard away, that is, he made them forget all about it. (12)
\tqe Some heard it, received it excitedly and believed it for a while. But when troubles came to them, they stopped believing it. (13)
\tqe Some heard it, but the good things of this world became more important to them than God's message and took over its place in their lives. They thought about the things in this world more and more and they thought about God less and less. Before very long, other people could tell by their words and actions that they did not believe in God any more. (14)
\tqe Some who were honest and good heard it and kept it in their hearts and minds. Even through troubles, they continued to believe it. Finally, other people saw many good things that pleased God in their lives. (15)

\rf Luke 8:16-18 Jesus used a lamp to explain that he would not hide the truth about the kingdom of God.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 8.16-18
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted to teach the people by means of this story about a lamp and its light?
\tqe The purpose of a lamp is to help people by making light for them to see clearly. Jesus was like the lamp that God had put on earth to make the truths about the kingdom of God clear to those who listened carefully.
\dh Details
\bttq Why do people light lamps?
\tqe People light lamps to give light when they cannot see otherwise. (16)
\bttq What does a person do with a lamp after he lights it?
\tqe He puts/places it out where it can be useful, as on a lamp holder. He does not hide it under anything. (16)
\bttq When the lamp is lit, what will happen to things that a person could not see in the dark?
\tqe The person (and others who are nearby) will see them clearly. They will not be hidden any more. (17)
\bttq Why should a person listen well to what Jesus taught us about the kingdom of God?
\tqe The person who understands/believes [even a small amount] will receive [help from God] to understand/believe more. (18)
\bttq What will happen to a person who does not have any understanding/faith?
\tqe [God] will even take away what little understanding/faith he thought that he had. (18)

\bttq Why did someone need to tell Jesus about them?
\tqe The crowd of people was so large that they could not get near Jesus. (19)

\tqe Those [people] who hear God's word and do [what it says] are as important to him as his blood relatives.
\tqe -OR-

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 8.22-25
\bttq Tell me what happened to Jesus and his disciples in their boat.
\tqe (The answer should cover the basic outline of the story, including Jesus rebuking the storm and the lake as well as rebuking his disciples. Any part which the person does not mention can be reviewed by using a specific question from below.)
\bttq What can we learn about Jesus from what Luke wrote about the men in the boat?
\tqe Jesus showed that he had authority over all [the forces] of nature, [such as the wind/storm/ waves].
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 8.22-24
\bttq Where were Jesus and his disciples going in a boat?
\tqe They were going to the other side of the lake. (22)
\bttq What did Jesus do while they sailed their boat on that lake?
\tqe He fell asleep. (23)
\bttq What happened while Jesus slept?
\tqe A terrible windstorm blew down [from the surrounding mountains] onto the lake. (23)
\tqe The boat began to fill [with water] and the men were in danger [of drowning/dying]. (23)
\bttq What did the disciples do and say to Jesus?
\tqe They woke Jesus and told him they were about to be destroyed [by the storm]. (24a)
\bttq What did the disciples think would be the final outcome of this storm?
\tqe They thought that they would violently die [by drowning]. (23-24a)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek word that describes what the disciples thought would happen to them focuses on the destruction and total ruin of people or objects. It is the same word that  was used in 5:37 to describe what happened to the wineskins. See "destroy, perish, (be lost" in KBT.)
\tqref LUK 8.24-25
\bttq After the disciples woke Jesus, what did he do?
\tqe He sternly commanded/rebuked the wind and the violent, tossing waves (and the storm stopped, and all was calm again). (24)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus asked/talked about the disciples' faith?
\tqe They had acted just as though they did not believe that he had God's power to do whatever he wanted to do. // They had seen Jesus do great things by God's power, but they did not trust him to save himself and them now. // Their reaction to the storm was the same as the reaction of people who had no faith in God. (25) (See "faith" in KBT in the "believe" entry.)
\bttq Why were the disciples amazed at what had happened?
\tqe They had seen Jesus use [God's/his] authority over the winds and the water, and they did what he told them to do. (25) (They knew that ordinary people did not have any control over the natural elements.)
\bttq The storm had ended. Why were the disciples still afraid?
\tqe They realized that they were in the presence of one who had supernatural power to command even the winds and the water to obey him. He was not an ordinary person, as they were. (25)

\rf Luke 8:26-39 Jesus made many demons/evil spirits leave a man.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 8.26-39
\bttq Jesus cast many demons out of one particular man. What can we learn about Jesus from that?
\tqe Jesus showed that he had authority over all the fierce demons, [even those outside of Jewish territory].
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus wanted to help all people, even those who were not Jews and who did not live among the Jews.
\an (Note: These people had the same response to Jesus doing a miracle among them as his disciples had on the lake a short time earlier. Both groups were afraid of Jesus' great power being present among them. These Gerasene/Gadarene/Gergesene people rejected Jesus, but the man who was healed, and the disciples earlier, believed that God had sent Jesus.)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 8.26-29
\bttq Where is the area where Jesus [and his disciples] went ashore?
\tqe It is on the other side of the lake across from Galilee [province], in the land of the Gerasene/Gadarene/Gergesene [people]. (26)
\an (Note: You may want to note in a reference to a map or in a footnote that Jesus was now outside the area the Jews regarded as their own land. The people to whom he talked there were not Jews and they did not worship the true God.)
\bttq Whom did Jesus meet when he went ashore?
\tqe He met a demon-possessed man from the [nearby] town. (27)
\bttq What did Luke tell us about this man?
\tqe The man was from the town [of Gerasa nearby]. (27)
\tqe He had not worn clothes for a long time. (27)
\tqe He did not live in a house, but stayed among the tombs. (27)
\tqe When he saw Jesus [coming], he cried out, (28)
\tqe dropped to the ground, lying flat in front of Jesus [as a sign that he submitted himself to Jesus] (28)
\tqe and shouted out in a loud voice. (28)
\tqe Many times the demons had seized/controlled the man. (29)
\tqe  [People] tried to restrain the man by tying his hands and feet with chains (29)
\tqe and then guarded him, (29)
\tqe but many times the man had broken the chains (29)
\tqe and the demon had driven him into a region with no inhabitants/into the wilderness. (29)
\bttq What did the man shout in the loud voice to Jesus?
\tqe He shouted, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I plead with/ appeal to you, do not torture me!" (28)
\an (Note: The question is a rhetorical one. The man was not asking Jesus for an answer. He was implying that, because Jesus was so different from himself in a spiritual sense, Jesus should leave the man and the spirits in him alone.]
\bttq Why did the man say this?
\tqe Jesus had already commanded the evil spirit/demon to come out of the man. (29)
\an (Note: It is also implied that the demon was saying that he and Jesus had nothing in common, so he did not want anything to do with Jesus, who might punish him.)
\bttq How was it, do you think, that the man already knew Jesus' name and that he was the son of God?
\tqe Demons know who God is, and who God's son is, [because God has authority over them].
\tqref LUK 8.30-33
\bttq What did the demon say his name was?
\tqe His name was Legion/Thousands/A great many. (30)
\bttq Why did the demon say his name was that?
\tqe He said that because many demons had entered the man. (30)
\bttq What did the demons keep on urging/earnestly ask/strongly request Jesus not to do to them?
\tqe They did not want him to command them to go to the Abyss, the deep hole with no bottom. (31)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "abyss" in KBT in the "hell, Hades, abyss" entry. It is the place where God imprisoned evil spirits and they suffer torment ever since he expelled them from heaven. [see Rev. 20:3. They will not leave there until the Judgment. If the term is not clear in the text, use a footnote or glossary item to explain about this place. [See Matt. 8:29.])
\bttq Where did those demons want Jesus to send them instead?
\tqe They wanted to go into the herd of [a great] many pigs which was feeding on the mountainside. (32)
\bttq What happened after Jesus permitted those demons to go into that herd of pigs?
\tqe The herd of pigs then rushed/charged/stampeded down the steep bank/slope into the lake and drowned. (33)
\tqref LUK 8.34-37
\bttq What did the men who looked after those pigs do?

\bttq What did the people who heard the men's report do?
\tqe They went out to see what had happened. (35)
\bttq What did those people see when they came to where Jesus was?
\tqe They found the man who had earlier had demons in him now sitting near Jesus' feet. (35)
\tqe He was dressed and he was thinking clearly. (35)
\bttq How did they feel after seeing the man act so differently than before?
\tqe They were afraid. (35)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that they were afraid?
\tqe They were afraid because they knew it meant that Jesus had great power to drive out those demons from the man.
\bttq How did those people learn about what had happened to the man who had demons in him?
\tqe The people who had seen [Jesus] heal him told them. (36)
\bttq Why did all the people who lived in that area ask Jesus to leave?
\tqe They were completely afraid [of Jesus' great power which they thought might do more harm than good]. (37)
\bttq How did Jesus respond to their request?
\tqe He got into the boat and left. (37)
\tqref LUK 8.38-39
\bttq What did the man who earlier had demons in him want to do?
\tqe He pleaded with/appealed to Jesus to allow him to go with Jesus [in the boat]. (38)
\bttq When the man was asking to go with Jesus, where do you think Jesus was?
\tqe Jesus was still there in the man's country, walking to the boat or even getting into the boat.
\an (Note: The last word of 8:37 in the Greek is "he-returned", and in the NIV, "... and left." But what happened in 8:38-39a took place before Jesus actually left the man. To help readers avoid becoming confused about the order of events, combine the numbering for verses 37-39 and describe the events in the order of verse 38, 39a, 37, and then 39b.)
\bttq What did Jesus tell the man to do?
\tqe He told him to return home and tell [people] what God had done for him. (39)

\tqe They had been across the lake with the Gerasene/Gadarene/Gergesene people. (26, 37)
\bttq To where, do you think, did Jesus and his disciples return?
\tqe They returned to Galilee province, as both of the towns which were last named by Luke were in Galilee. (See the reference in 7:1 to Capernaum and in 7:11 to Nain.)
\bttq How did people greet Jesus when he arrived back in Galilee?
\tqe They welcomed him./They were happy he had returned./They were waiting eagerly for him. (40)

\tqe touched the edge of his outer clothing (44),
\tqe and was healed (44).
\bttq What was the woman's sickness?
\tqe For twelve years she had suffered from excessive [menstrual] bleeding. (43)
\bttq (See the Note first.)  What had the woman done to try to be healed?
\tqe  She had paid all her [money] to doctors [to help her], but no one had been able to heal her/stop the bleeding. (43)
\an (Note: Many Bible scholars do not believe that Luke wrote the words that we find in some manuscripts about paying doctors. Therefore, the translator may not have included it in this translation, or it may be set apart by special use of punctuation. If those words are not in the translation, then skip this question.)
\tqref LUK 8.45-48
\bttq Why did Jesus ask, "Who touched me?"
\tqe He knew that [healing] power had gone out from him. (46)
\bttq Why did Peter object?

\bttq Why did the woman finally come to Jesus and tell the reason for touching him?
\tqe She realized that she could not remain anonymous, that Jesus was not going to ignore this. (47)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that she trembled as she came to Jesus?
\tqe She had to tell her story in front of all those people. (47)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe She feared that Jesus would be upset with her or even take away her healing [because she had not asked, and then she had hesitated to speak when Jesus asked his question].
\an (Note: The woman was also ritually unclean, so she was not to touch any man. [See Lev. 15:19, 25 and 19:22.] )
\bttq Jesus was not a father, but he called this woman by the title, "Daughter". What do you think that he meant by calling her "Daughter"?
\tqe Though she was not his real daughter, he wanted to show her that he cared about her and was not angry with her.
\an (Note: "Daughter" may not be the term used by the culture of the translation to show this same meaning. Use a culturally appropriate kin term or title for Jesus to address this woman. He wanted to show that he was friendly and caring as a father would be when helping his daughter.)

\bttq What were other people at Jairus' house doing?
\tqe They were wailing and mourning/showing their sorrow for the [dead] girl. (52)
\an (Note: One of the Greek words for what the people were doing describes their cultural practice of showing sorrow by beating on one's own chest. If the culture of the translation has words for both the crying about a person's death and for a cultural practice always associated with showing one's sadness, both of those terms should be used here.)
\bttq Why did Jesus tell those people to stop wailing?
\tqe He said that the child was not dead, but sleeping. (52)
\bttq Why did the people laugh at/make fun of Jesus?
\tqe They knew that the child was dead [so they assumed that Jesus was joking or did not know the truth]. (53)

\tqe They were also to heal the sick. (2)
\an (Note: This "healing of the sick" probably included casting out demons from people who were bothered/controlled by them.)
\bttq How were the twelve apostles going to be able to do the great things that Jesus had been doing?
\tqe He gave them power and authority to drive/cast out all demons and to cure diseases. (1)
\bttq What did the apostles do when they went around to villages?
\tqe They announced the Good News and healed people everywhere. (6)
\an (Note: The NIV uses the words "preaching the gospel" in this verse. This translates the Greek word which means "tell good news". The translator should use the same wording here that he used in 3:18 and 4:18 to talk about this message. It was the same message which John and Jesus had preached. [See "gospel" in KBT.])
\dh Details
\bttq What were the apostles to take with them on their travels?
\tqe They were to take nothing; no walking stick, no bag, no money, no food and no extra clothes. (3)
\bttq Those are all things people take with them when they go on a long walk to another place, even today. In what way, do you think, would the disciples get the things they might need?
\tqe Jesus expected them to trust God to provide for their needs. (They really would have to begin allowing God to rule in their lives.)
\bttq Where were the disciples to stay when they visited a village?
\tqe They should stay the whole time they were at that village in the first house where they were welcomed. (4)
\bttq What were they to do if the town's people did not welcome them?
\tqe They were to leave that town. As they were leaving, they were to shake off the dust from their feet. (5)
\bttq What would that action do besides help clean their feet?
\tqe It would show the town's people that the apostles were separating themselves from them. (5)
\tqe It would show that the apostles didn't want even dust from that place to go with them [in the work Jesus had given them]. (5)
\tqe It would show that the one who had sent the apostles, Jesus/God, would be angry with those people because of their unbelief. (5)
\an (Note: This custom was practiced by the Jews when they left a non-Jewish/Gentile town because just being there would make the Jews ritually unclean. Then they could not worship at the temple. If the apostles did this in Jewish villages and towns, townspeople would know that they were being treated as people who rejected God.)

\tqe When people found out where Jesus was, they followed him [to that place]. (11)
\bttq How did Jesus treat the crowd that followed him there?
\tqe He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God and healed those who needed to be healed. (11)
\tqref LUK 9.12-14
\bttq Why did the twelve apostles want Jesus to send the people away?
\tqe The people needed to go where others lived (in surrounding villages or on farms) in order to have a place to stay [for the night] and in order to find enough food to eat. This was necessary because they were in an uninhabited place and it was getting late in the day. (12)
\bttq Did Jesus send all those people away like his disciples suggested to him?
\tqe No, he did not.
\bttq What did he do?
\tqe He told his disciples to give food to the people. (13)
\bttq How much food did the disciples have altogether?
\tqe They had five bread rolls and two [smoked/cooked] fish. (13)
\an (Note: The "bread" of the Middle Eastern cultures is not the size or shape of the loaf of bread common among Westerners. The word used for "fish" either should imply small ones that one person could easily eat at one meal, or it should not imply anything about size. The same story in John 6:9 makes it clear they were small fish or only portions of fish that were ready to be eaten with the bread. [See L&N entry 5.16.])
\bttq How many people were there with the disciples?
\an 5,000 people were there, counting only the men. (14a)
\an (Note: There were probably much fewer women and children present than men because it was far from where people normally lived. Also remember that the Jews began calling a boy a man after he had been through the ritual at the temple at the age of 12 or 13, as Jesus had done. Each culture begins to use the term "man" after different events and different ages. The terms used here should cover all the males aged 13 and older. For example, the Hewa translation in Papua New Guinea used the words "5,000 married-men and mature-boys".)
\bttq Do you think that the disciples wanted to go somewhere to get enough food for all those people?
\tqe No, they did not. They said earlier that no one lived nearby. It was an impossible option. (Besides, they would need a lot of money and more than 12 men to carry enough food back to that place. See Mark 6:35-37.)
\tqref LUK 9.14-17
\bttq What did Jesus tell the disciples to do about this problem?
\tqe They were to have the people get ready to eat by siting/relaxing [on the ground] in groups of fifty. (14b)
\bttq What did Jesus do about food for all those people?
\tqe He took the five bread rolls and two fish, and (16)
\tqe while looking up towards heaven, he blessed the food, (16)
\tqe then broke it [into pieces] (16)
\tqe and gave [the pieces] to his disciples to distribute to the crowd. (16)
\bttq How do we know there was enough food for all those people?
\tqe Luke wrote that all the people ate enough to be satisfied, and
\tqe [the disciples] carried away twelve basketfuls of leftover food pieces. (17)

\rf Luke 9:18-20 Peter said that Jesus was the Christ sent by God.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.18-20
\bttq What do you think that Peter's answer to Jesus showed about the disciples?
\tqe They now recognized/believed that he was the Christ, the one whom God had sent to save his people as he had promised. (20)
\dh Details
\bttq What was Jesus doing before he asked his disciples these questions?
\tqe He was praying alone/by himself. (18)
\bttq What were his questions about?
\tqe His questions were about what the crowds of people and the disciples were saying about Jesus. (18, 20)
\bttq What were other people saying about Jesus?
\tqe They said that he was John the Baptizer, or Elijah or one of the [other] prophets of long ago who had risen from the dead. (19)
\bttq Who did the disciples say that Jesus was?
\tqe Peter said that Jesus was God's Christ, (the person God had set apart for coming to this earth to save his people). (20) (See "Christ, Messiah" in KBT.)
\an (Note: The Greek word order shows us that Jesus was making a strong contrast between the crowd's thinking and the disciples' thinking. It would be good if the translation could show that contrast. In English, it might be like this: "And you? Who do you say that I am?")
\bttq Jesus strongly warned/sternly commanded his disciples not to tell anyone what they knew about him. What did they know?
\tqe They knew that he was the Christ/Messiah. (20)

\rf Luke 9:21-27 Jesus said that he would die, but God would raise him to live again.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.21-27
\bttq How would people treat Jesus?
\tqe People would make him suffer; they would reject him [and his claim to be the Christ] and kill him. (22)
\bttq How would God treat Jesus?
\tqe God would raise him back to life again (three days after that). (22)
\bttq How should a person act who truly wants to follow Jesus?
\tqe He must do as Jesus did, being committed each day to God, even when the things of this world look like they will make that person very happy or when people might make fun of him because he believes in Jesus as the savior. Each day that person must deny his human desire to take good care of himself by focusing on getting more and more possessions. Owning all the things in the world will not keep him from dying or being killed. He must do as Jesus did, even if it leads to suffering, rejection or being killed. That will lead him to the kind of life God wants him to have. (23-25)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 9.21-22
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus told the disciples not to tell anyone yet about this? (21)
\tqe He didn't want them to tell other people yet because the Jews had wrongly understood what kind of a savior the Messiah would be. He needed more time to teach more Jews the truth about the savior whom God had now sent.
\bttq Whom was Jesus talking about when he spoke about the Son of Man? (22)
\tqe He was talking about himself.
\an (Note: See comments at 5:24.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen to him?
\tqe He must suffer many things/in many ways/much. (22)
\tqe The elders [of the Jews] and the chief priests and the teachers of the Law/scribes would reject him/his claim to be the Messiah. (22)
\tqe People would kill him. (22)
\tqe [God] would raise him [from the dead/to live again] on the third day [of his being dead]. (22)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus named those three specific groups of people who would reject him and what he had to say about himself?
\tqe Those three groups were the leaders who together decided what was right or wrong for the Jews to do or think. They would influence all the other people as to what they should think about Jesus or do to him.
\tqe Key Term Check:
\an  The elders [of the Jews] were the older and wiser Jewish men who met to discuss problems in their Jewish society and culture.
\an  The chief priests were the leaders among the priests at the temple in Jerusalem. They decided everything that had to do with worship of God and use of the temple grounds. (See "Chief Priest, High Priest" in KBT.)
\an  The teachers of the Law/scribes were the ones who knew best how to apply the laws God had told to Moses in everyday Jewish life. (See the answer back at 5:17.)

\bttq What must one do if he wants to follow Jesus?
\tqe He should deny himself, (23)
\tqe take up his cross each day and (23)
\tqe follow Jesus. (23)
\bttq What do you think it means to deny oneself? (23)
\tqe It means that a person does not think only about himself and those things which make him happy. (Jesus wanted people to think about how to please God and be totally committed to him first.)
\bttq At the time Jesus lived, when a person carried a cross, what do you think it meant? (23)
\tqe It meant that person was on his way to die (by being nailed on crossed timbers until he could not breathe anymore).
\tqe Key Term Check: See "cross, crucify" in KBT.
\bttq What do you think it means for people today to take up/carry one's cross?
\tqe It means that a person must accept whatever suffering comes because he is one who follows Jesus. He must be willing to die in order to remain faithful to God, even die in a humiliating way like those who died on a cross.
\bttq How often must the person who follows Jesus put his focus on God, not himself? (23)
\tqe He must do it every day. Every day he must be willing to suffer whatever happens to him because he has put God first in his life. (This is not an action that a person does once and then forgets about it.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen to the person who wanted to save his own life?
\tqe He said that person would lose it. (24)
\bttq That sounds like a contradiction in the way that people understand life and death. What do you think that Jesus meant by that?
\tqe The person who does not do as Jesus just said in verse 23 will lose his chance to have the eternal life that Jesus promised elsewhere in the gospels.
\tqe He may also die physically just as Jesus said that he would in verse 22.
\an (Note: Luke had not written anything about eternal life up to this point in his gospel. Therefore, if the language assistant has not been a worshipping Christian for a long time, he will find that this question is impossible to answer. He has no background to fit it into, and the words are a paradox. Do not be critical of anyone's answer to this question.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen when a person loses his life because he follows Jesus?
\tqe He said that person would save it. (24)
\bttq This, too, sounds like a contradiction in terms. What do you think that Jesus meant by saying that?
\tqe He was not talking about a person's physical life, so he must have been referring again to spiritual life that is eternal. The person who does as Jesus said in verse 23 will receive the eternal life that Jesus promised.
\bttq What did Jesus say about a person who gains control or becomes the owner of everything in the world?
\tqe He has gained nothing important if it means that he loses or gives up his own spirit [for all of eternity]. // He has given up the most important, eternal thing in order to have pleasure in this short life. The trade is not worth it, Jesus said. (25)
\bttq What will happen to the person who is ashamed when other people know he follows Jesus and obeys what he taught?
\tqe The Son of Man, Jesus, will be ashamed of him/her when he comes [back to this earth from heaven, not from the grave,] surrounded by his [own] glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels. (26)
\tqe Key Term Check: See the discussion about "glory" at 2:9 and 2:14.
\bttq Who is this "Father" Jesus was talking about?
\tqe He is Jesus' father, God, who is also our spiritual father. (See 6:35-36.)
\bttq Luke has not written anything in the earlier parts of this book about Jesus going away and coming back. To what, do you think, was he referring?
\tqe Jesus told us elsewhere in the gospels that one day he will come back from heaven to judge all the people on the earth. (See Matt. 16:27; 25:31-47; Mark 13:32-37; Luke 21:8-28.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen before some of the people who were standing there would die?
\tqe Some of them would see/experience/give their attention to the kingdom of God.
\an (Note: The Greek word translated "see" is used in many contexts, from ordinary seeing with one's eyes to meanings which include more and more mental understanding which becomes clearer. These would include meanings such as, "pay attention to", "take notice of" and "be concerned about". It also is used figuratively to mean "experience". [See John 3:36 and Heb. 11:5.] The exact meaning to which Jesus referred when using this word in this verse is not altogether clear. Some of the possibilities are listed below.)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.28-36
\bttq Tell me what happened to Jesus and three of his disciples on a mountain.
\tqe (The answer should cover the basic outline of the story, including:
\tqe Jesus' appearance changing, [that is, his face and his clothing looked different],
\tqe Moses and Elijah appearing and talking with Jesus,
\tqe the bright light,
\tqe the disciples' sleepiness and Peter's suggestion about building temporary shelters for
\tqe the three,
\tqe hearing God's voice speaking from the cloud which surrounded them
\tqe and their not telling anyone about the incident until later on.
\tqe Any part which is not mentioned can be asked about from a specific question below.)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted to teach or show these disciples by having them see these things happen on the mountain?
\tqe God was confirming that everything Jesus had taught them just the week before, as Luke recorded it  in 9:22-27, really was true. They must listen to Jesus and know that the glory about which he had spoken would still come.
\tqe
\tqe (He wanted these few disciples to have a brief look at the glory he had been talking about which would come in the kingdom of God. The glory would first be Jesus' and, later on, every believers'. The glory existed already, but God had not yet fully revealed it to all the people. Not even all the believers had experienced it  yet.
\tqe They also heard the voice of God telling them that they must listen to Jesus. This was another witness confirming what they had heard Jesus himself already say. He was the one the disciples must follow, regardless of what the religious leaders told them. God had said so directly to them. What Jesus had just taught them in verses 22-27 was that he had insisted on suffering as the way to glory. He also had called on them to give up their own physical lives to gain eternal life, even to bear their own suffering because of their faith in him and follow him through his suffering.)

\bttq Where did Jesus take Peter, James, and John?
\tqe He took them up onto a mountain. (28)
\bttq Why did they go there?
\tqe They went there to pray. (28)
\bttq What happened to Jesus while he prayed?
\tqe The way that his face looked changed and
\tqe his clothing became sparkling/dazzling/radiant white. (29)
\bttq What did Luke write about Moses and Elijah?
\tqe They appeared in their heavenly glory/brightness and talked with Jesus. (31)
\bttq What did they talk about with Jesus?
\tqe They talked with him about his leaving [this world] while he was at Jerusalem. (31)
\bttq What do you think they meant by saying that Jesus would be leaving this world?
\tqe They meant that the events that would happen to Jesus at Jerusalem, namely, his dying, rising again would lead to his ascending into heaven.
\bttq What were the disciples doing?
\tqe They were asleep/kept falling asleep. (They were not praying.) (32)
\bttq What did the disciples see when they were fully awake?
\tqe They saw [the brightness of] his glory and the two men standing with him. (32)
\bttq When Peter saw all that, what did he suggest to Jesus that they (the three disciples) should do?
\tqe He felt good about being there, so he wanted to build three shelters, one each for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. (33)
\bttq In what way, do you think, did Peter not know what he was really saying?
\tqe He did not think about the meaning or implications of his words. He seems to have wanted to do something to keep Moses and Elijah there for a longer time. Spirit beings from heaven did not need physical shelters for protection or comfort.
\tqref LUK 9.34-36
\bttq What happened while Peter was speaking?
\tqe A bright cloud appeared and it surrounded/covered/enveloped them all. (34)
\bttq How did the disciples feel about that?
\tqe They were afraid [of all that was happening to them so suddenly/mysteriously]. (34)
\bttq Whose voice was it which spoke in that cloud?
\tqe God's voice spoke.
\bttq How do you know it was God who spoke?
\tqe He called Jesus his son whom he had chosen [to come into the world to die for mankind's sins]. (35)
\an (Note: The cloud and the brightness were also signs in the Old Testament that God was present. Any voice which people heard in that context was always God's voice. God had already spoken once from heaven when Jesus had been baptized by John [Luke 3:22].)
\bttq What did God say about Jesus?
\tqe He said that Jesus was God's son and God had chosen him [to be the Christ/Messiah/savior]. (35)
\bttq What did God say that the disciples should do?
\tqe They must listen to what Jesus taught them. (35)
\an (Note: The Greek wording emphasizes that Jesus is the one they must listen to and obey. When the religious leaders would later openly oppose Jesus concerning the writings of Moses and the prophets, the disciples knew that God had already told them directly whom they must obey.  When those same leaders would order the disciples to stop talking about Jesus,  the disciples could show from the Old Testament that they must follow God's instructions, not men's.)
\bttq What did the disciples see when the voice and the cloud had left?
\tqe Only Jesus was there [with them, not Moses and Elijah or God]. (36)
\bttq To whom did the disciples tell what they had seen and heard?
\tqe They told no one, but kept silent for the time being. (36)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.37-43a
\bttq What happened when Jesus and the three disciples came down from the mountain?
\tqe A crowd met them.
\tqe A man in that crowd had a son whom a spirit seized, caused him to have convulsions and would not leave him alone.
\tqe The boy also foamed at the mouth.
\tqe The other disciples had not been able to heal him, so the father pleaded with/appealed to Jesus to do it.
\tqe Jesus was upset with the disciples/all the crowd for not believing strongly that God could free this boy.
\tqe Jesus rebuked the demon, healed the boy, and gave him back into his father's care.
\tqe Everyone was amazed at the power of God.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus was so upset?
\tqe He had given all twelve disciples power and authority over these things earlier (9:1). He had told them that the religious officials would reject his teachings and cause him to suffer and die because of it (9:22). They needed to believe completely in Jesus. However, they did not believe as completely as Peter had implied they did when he confessed his belief in who Jesus really was (9:20). Most of the other people also had followed Jesus regularly and heard what he had taught. He knew he was going to leave them all soon and did not have a lot of time to keep on teaching them. They should already have believed completely. This made him upset.

\tqe He begged Jesus to drive out the [evil] spirit that seized him (40), making the boy scream, have convulsions, and foam at the mouth. (It left the boy battered and bruised.) (39)
\bttq Had anyone else tried to help this man and his boy?
\tqe Yes, the other [nine] disciples had tried, but they had not been able to cast out the spirit. (40)
\bttq What does it mean to "cast out a spirit/demon" from a person?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means ordering the demon to immediately leave the person alone and go away.
\bttq How often had that spirit bothered the boy?
\tqe The spirit hardly ever left the boy alone. Because it attacked the boy so often, that [evil] spirit was destroying/killing the boy. (39)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The spirit had never left the boy easily. Whenever it had gone away, the boy was left badly injured from the wild thrashing of his body. (39)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the father was so worried that he now pleaded for help?
\tqe He loved his son very much. Also, he probably needed the son to carry on the family lineage and family name and to care for/support him when he became old.
\tqref LUK 9.41-43a
\bttq What kind of people did Jesus say these people were?
\tqe He said that they were unbelieving and morally wrong/crooked/wicked. (41)
\bttq How long did Jesus sound as though he wanted to stay and put up with their slow learning? (41)
\tqe He did not want to stay any extra time. He had told them everything that was important for them to believe and to live as members of God's kingdom. Jesus knew that his remaining time on earth was short. God would not delay his plan for Jesus to take away mankind's sin.
\bttq What did Jesus do about the boy?
\tqe He told the boy's father to bring his son to him (Jesus). (41)
\tqe He sternly commanded the demon [to leave the boy], (42)
\tqe healed the boy, (42)
\tqe and returned him to his father's care. (42)
\bttq What did all the crowd think about this?

\tqe He told them that someone would betray [him,] the Son of Man, into the hands/control of other men. (44)
\bttq What do you think it means to betray someone into other people's hands/control?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means to deliver that person into the control of someone whom that person regards as an enemy. The person who betrays another pretends to be a friend or of the same mind as the person who is being betrayed, and then tricks him into making himself vulnerable/accessible to the enemy.
\bttq What were all the other people doing while Jesus talked to his disciples?
\tqe All the other people were [still] talking about being amazed at what Jesus had done. (43b)
\bttq How did the disciples respond to what Jesus told them?
\tqe Even though Jesus had told them to let the words really get set in their minds (that is, listen carefully and not forget), they did not understand what he meant. (45)
\bttq Why did they not understand?
\tqe The clear meaning had been hidden [by God]. As a result, they did not understand it yet. (45)

\bttq Why did they not ask Jesus to explain it more clearly?
\tqe They were afraid to ask him about it.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the disciples were afraid to ask Jesus to explain his words?
\an (Note: There are several possible reasons that they were afraid to ask. Any one of these would be an adequate answer:)

\tqe They may have been afraid he would actually tell them about some terrible thing that was going to happen to him, that is, that he would be more specific about how he was going to die at the hand of others.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They thought that all he had said on this matter was too mysterious to want to know more about it.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus just had been angry with the people because they did not believe him. The disciples did not understand his teaching, so they did not want him to know that they did not understand this, either. He might really be angry with them then.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus just had shown everyone that he had God's power over evil spirits. It did not seem possible that anyone could trick/fool/betray Jesus into his enemies' hands/control. Therefore, they were afraid to ask about this.

\bttq What were the disciples arguing about among themselves?
\tqe They argued about which of them would be the greatest/most important person [in their group of 12/in the kingdom of God]. (46)
\bttq How did Jesus know about their discussion?
\tqe He knew because he was the son of God. No one told him about it. (47)
\bttq What did Jesus do with a small child?
\tqe He got a small child and had him stand beside Jesus. (47)
\tqe Then Jesus used that child as a focal point for what he told the disciples about being great/ important. (48)
\bttq How did Jesus use this child to teach a lesson to the disciples?
\tqe When a person accepts/welcomes and cares for a child like that one in Jesus' name, it is the same as though that person is accepting/welcoming Jesus. And whoever welcomes Jesus is also welcoming/ accepting [God] who sent him [into this world]. (48)
\tqe (A person whom God considers great/important is one who accepts the work of serving unimportant, ordinary people, as represented by this child. That person's attitude shows that he wants to serve Jesus, and God, who sent Jesus to this earth.)
\bttq What do you think it means to do something "in the name of Jesus"?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means doing something as Jesus' representative, in his place, or because we love him. It is doing something on the basis of who Jesus was and what he did, that he was holy and that he perfectly reflected God's love to all who would accept him. He did not do it for great honor, but because he loved God, he served him by doing what God wanted him to do among the people here on earth. (See "in the name of" in KBT in the "name" entry.)

\bttq What do you think that it means here to do that work "in Jesus' name"? [Note: Only use this question if the translation does not make the meaning clear.]
\tqe The power and authority of Jesus are in his name. Calling on the name of Jesus and doing something in his name means that you are doing it with the power and authority of Jesus himself.

\an (Note: Hundreds of years earlier, the king of Assyria had taken most of the Jews away as captives [see 2 Kings 17:24-41]. He had then sent people from other lands to live in that area. They married with the few Jews whom the king had left behind. The Samaritans were the descendants of those people. They had to be taught about God, but since the Assyrian king had destroyed the temple in Jerusalem, the Samaritans developed their own worship places and ways to worship. When the Jews returned from being captives, they rebuilt the temple in Jerusalem and stayed separate from the Samaritans, having nothing to do with them.)
\bttq What did the Samaritan people decide about Jesus and his disciples staying in their village?
\tqe They did not welcome/accept him, that is they refused to allow him to stay. (53)
\bttq Why did they refuse to have him stay there?
\tqe Because he was headed towards Jerusalem [to worship in the Jewish temple there]. (53)
\an (Note: Because Jesus was headed to Jerusalem to worship, it meant that he did not regard the Samaritans' temple on Mt. Gerazim nearby as a proper place in which to worship the true God. This offended the Samaritans.)
\bttq What did the disciples James and John want to do to the Samaritans?
\tqe They asked Jesus if he wanted them to call fire down from heaven to destroy those people. (54)
\bttq How did Jesus respond to them?
\tqe He turned towards them and sternly rebuked them/commanded them [to stop thinking that way]. (55)
\bttq What did Jesus and the disciples do when they were not allowed to stay in that particular place?
\tqe They went on to another [Samaritan] village. (56)

\rf Luke 9:57-62 People who want to follow Jesus must let go of everything else they think is important.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.57-62
\bttq What do you think that Jesus would want us to learn from these examples about following him?
\tqe To follow Jesus means putting his desires for us as more important in our lives than our desires for our own well-being. We must come to him with no conditions, just as he followed his father's will in his own life. He had no desire for his own well-being, but his only desire was to do his father's will.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 9.57-58
\bttq Where were Jesus and his disciples going?
\tqe They were still headed towards Jerusalem. (9:51)
\bttq A man approached Jesus along the road. What did this man say to Jesus?
\tqe He said that he would follow Jesus wherever Jesus went. (57)
\bttq What do you think the man meant that he wanted to do?
\tqe He wanted to be a [close] disciple of Jesus and learn from him while traveling around.
\bttq What do foxes and birds have that Jesus said he did not have?
\tqe Foxes have their [own] dens/holes/homes in the ground and birds have their [own] nests [for rest, safety, and shelter], but he had no such place [of his own] where he could rest/sleep. (58)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted that man to learn from his answer?
\tqe If the Son of Man, Jesus, had to live without the comfort of knowing he had his own safe home in which to rest, then his followers should not expect to have that, either. Knowing that other people [like those in the one Samaritan village] would not welcome him into their homes, then anyone who follows Jesus must expect the same thing to happen to him or her.
\tqref LUK 9.59-60
\bttq What was the response of another person to Jesus' call to follow him [and be his disciple]?
\tqe He wanted first to go [home] and care for his elderly father until the father [died and] was buried. (59)
\bttq Who did Jesus say should care for those who died?
\tqe Those who are [already] dead should care for the dead. (60)
\bttq That sounds impossible. What do you think that Jesus wanted the man to learn from that part of his answer?
\tqe Since dead people cannot do anything, Jesus must have meant that the people who have not repented from their sins (that is, those who are spiritually dead) and are not ruled by God (that is, those who are not in the kingdom of God), should care for those parents who need help and might die.
\bttq What did Jesus say was more important for that man to do than care for his father?
\tqe He must go and speak out about/proclaim the kingdom of God. (60)
\tqref LUK 9.61-62
\bttq What did another person want to do before following Jesus?
\tqe He wanted first to go back home and say good-bye to those who lived there/to his loved ones. (61)
\bttq What happens when a person wants to make straight lines for planting food (or, building a fence), but he/she regularly looks all around? (62)
\tqe He will have crooked rows for planting, so some plants will be too close together and other space will be useless.
\bttq What do you think is the way that this picture language of a man preparing his field/garden applies to serving in the kingdom of God?
\tqe The person who wants to be a disciple in the kingdom of God must keep his mind centered on God. In that way his work for God will be useful. Thinking about what he may have left behind, and longing for it, will slow him down and he will not be a useful worker (Luke 10:1-16).

\rf Luke 10:1-16 Jesus sent out 72 more disciples.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 10.1-16
\an  [Note: Some Greek manuscripts refer to only 70 disciples, but the editors of the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament, 4th revised edition, 1993, give a slight preference for the number "72" as the original number which Luke wrote here. You may have either number in the translation.]
\an
\bttq What work did Jesus tell these 72 other disciples to do?
\tqe They were to go ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go (1) and decide which places would welcome him and which would not welcome him (based on how well they had been received) (8, 10, 16).
\tqe They were to speak a blessing of peace wherever they were welcomed (5-6, 8), and to shake off the dust from their feet wherever they were not welcomed [in order to show that God did not approve of what the people who lived at that place had done] (10-12).
\tqe They were to heal the sick in the places which welcomed them (9), and in every place tell the people that the kingdom of God had come (9, 11).
\tqe They were to ask God to send out more workers [to those people who were ready to hear the Good News]. (2)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 10.1-4
\bttq How were these many disciples to divide into groups when they went to do this work?
\tqe They were to go two by two. (1)
\bttq Where were they supposed to go?
\tqe They were to go to every town and place where he was planning  to go. (1)
\bttq Tell me about workers and fields which are ready to be harvested. (2)
\tqe Often when a very big harvest is ready to be gathered, there is a need for more workers than are available. The food or grain must be gathered quickly before it falls, rots, spoils, or is ruined by bad weather. The workday is usually long and the work hard.
\an  (Note: In many places, as in Israel, food/seed is planted in all the fields/gardens at the same time because of the times of rain and sun. Therefore, all the food and grain is ready to harvest at about the same time, too. If the culture of the translation has no understanding of this kind of seasonal planting and harvesting, probably a glossary item needs to be prepared for this text.)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he talked about workers and fields?
\tqe He was not talking about real fields with food or grain that was ready to be harvested. This was picture language about the many people who were ready to believe in him when those disciples would tell them about the kingdom of God being present/the Good News that Jesus had come to save them.
\bttq What did Jesus say about the number of workers compared to the number of people ready to hear and believe the good news about the kingdom of God?
\tqe The workers were few, but the number of people who were ready to hear was plentiful/very many. (2)
\bttq Who, do you think, was the Lord of the harvest, the owner of the field of ripe food/grain?
\tqe God was.
\bttq Do you think that there are now enough workers in the world, or are there still more people who need to hear about the kingdom of God?
\tqe There are still many more people today who have not heard about God's love, so many more workers are needed to go and tell them.
\bttq Tell me what kind of animals wolves and lambs are. (3)
\tqe Wolves are a variety of fierce, wild dogs which like to eat meat. Lambs are baby sheep which have a gentle nature and eat grass. They have no way to protect themselves from a fierce animal like a wolf.
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he talked about lambs and wolves?
\tqe He was not talking about real animals. This is picture language about the disciples going out among people who would reject their message and might try to harm them. The disciples were not to be fierce, but gentle and harmless in their actions and words. (They were to depend on God to protect them.)
\bttq How were these disciples to get ready for going from place to place?
\tqe Jesus told them not to carry a money holder/purse/wallet, a bag [for extra things] or [extra] sandals/shoes. (4)
\bttq What were they to do if they met people as they walked from one place to another?
\tqe They were not to become involved in long conversations on the road, [but move on to do the work Jesus had sent them to do]. (4)
\tqref LUK 10.5-12
\bttq What were the disciples to do when they entered a house?
\tqe They were to bless [the people who lived in] that house with words of peace. (5)
\bttq What kind of peace do you think that was?
\tqe Key Term Check: This peace is a calm heart/spirit which is free from worry and quarreling because God's representative was in that house and brought Good News. (See "peace" in KBT.)
\bttq How, do you think, would a "man of peace" who lived in that house act towards Jesus' disciples? (6)
\tqe He probably would welcome them as the representatives of Jesus. He would be willing to listen to what the disciples said about the kingdom of God.
\bttq What will happen if the man of that house was not a man of peace?
\tqe The blessing of peace would not stay with that man, but it would return to the disciples [either to give them peace or to be as if they had never spoken it]. (6)
\bttq How were they to act when they stayed in someone's house?
\tqe They were to stay there during their whole time in that place, eating [and drinking] whatever the people gave them. (7)
\bttq What reason did Jesus give the disciples to make them feel comfortable about taking nothing along with them, and about staying in only one house and eating the food there?
\tqe He said that the worker was worthy to receive his pay. (7)
\bttq What were they to do in the places where they were welcomed?
\tqe They should eat what was given to them [by the people] (8),
\tqe heal the sick [people] who lived there,
\tqe and tell them, "The kingdom of God is near." (9)
\bttq What were they to do in the places where they were not welcomed?
\tqe They should go out into the streets [where many people would see them] (10)
\tqe and tell [the people there] why they were shaking the dust of that place off their feet [in protest] (11).
\tqe They should also tell those people that they should be fully aware that the kingdom of God was near [and they were not part of it yet]. (11)
\bttq What do you think was the purpose of telling those people once more that the kingdom of God was near?
\tqe The people would know that by rejecting the disciples and their message they were also rejecting their chance/the opportunity to become part of the kingdom of God. As the disciples left, so did the people's chance/opportunity.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The people would know that if they repented/changed their minds quickly, there was still one last chance while the disciples were in their town to tell them more, or they could arrange for Jesus to come and teach them.
\bttq With what did Jesus compare people who did not welcome the disciples whom he had sent?
\tqe He said that [the people of the town of] Sodom would bear/endure better the punishment God had for them on The Day [when he would judge all people] than [the people of] that town would be able to bear/endure the [even greater] punishment God had for them. (12)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He said that on The Day [when God would judge all people] [the people of] that town would have more/greater punishment [from God] than [the people of the town of] Sodom would suffer.
\an
\an (Note: There is much implied information in this verse which Jesus, the disciples, and Luke all understood, but which the people who will read this translation may not know. Depending on the level of general Bible knowledge among the people, it may be necessary to have a glossary item which explains that the people who lived in the town of Sodom many years earlier had sinned greatly and God would severely punish them [Gen. 19]. The people of Sodom did not know God's plan to send a savior, so they did not trust God for being saved. By comparison, the people of a town which rejected the disciples and their message about the savior would be punished even more than the people of Sodom.)
\tqref LUK 10.13-16
\bttq What judgment, do you think, was Jesus talking about in verse 14?
\tqe Jesus referred to the day/time when God will judge all the people of the world, dead or alive. They will either live with him forever or be punished in Hell forever. (See Matt. 25:31-46.)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "judge, judgment" in KBT.
\bttq Why should the people from the towns of Korazin/Chorazin and Bethsaida expect God to severely punish them when he judges all people?
\tqe The people in those towns saw [Jesus do] miracles [besides teach them about the kingdom of God], but they did not believe him and repent. (13)
\bttq Jesus probably did the same things in those two towns that he had done in Capernaum and other cities of the Jews. What kinds of miracles do you think those people saw Jesus do? (Any two or three of these items will make an adequate answer.)
\tqe He cast demons out of people (4:33-36),
\tqe he cured any illness or disease (4:38-40), even leprosy (5:13),
\tqe he healed physical problems (5:17, 26 and 6:6, 10),
\tqe he raised dead people to be alive again (7:14-16),
\tqe he calmed a storm (8:23-25),
\tqe and he fed thousands of people with a very small amount of food (9:16-17).
\bttq What do you understand it is that makes something be called "a miracle"?
\tqe Key Term Check: A miracle is something which happens in our physical world that is different from the way that people know that the processes of nature take place. Spirit beings, such as God, use their great power to do these things. (See "miracle, sign, wonder, mighty work" in KBT. Also see the note in L&N, following entry 76.8.)
\an (Note: In the NT, all the miracles occurred so that the individual or the group of people who saw it happen would desire a stronger relationship with God.)
\bttq How did Jesus compare these two towns, Korazin/Chorazin and Bethsaida with other cities? (13)
\tqe If the people who lived in the [Gentile/non-Jewish] towns of Tyre and Sidon had seen those miracles, they would have sat in sackcloth and ashes to show that they had repented; but the people in these two Jewish towns had not repented. (13)
\tqe The people of Tyre and Sidon would bear/endure better [the punishment God had for them] when he would judge [all people on The Last Day] than these people would be able to bear/endure the [even greater] punishment God had for them. // When [God] judges [everyone on The Last Day], he will not punish the people of Tyre and Sidon as severely as he will punish the people of Korazin and Bethsaida. (14)
\bttq What do you think it would have meant if the people of Korazin and Bethsaida had sat in sackcloth and ashes? (13)
\tqe It was the cultural way to show great sorrow and mourning when a great tragedy had occurred.  In this case, they would have been showing great sorrow for their sins against God and their desire to obey him from then onward.
\an (Note: If this is not the custom for showing sorrow and repentance in the language area, it would be good to make the purpose clear in the text.)
\bttq What should people in the town of Capernaum expect to happen to them in the time when God will judge all people?
\tqe They should expect to be sent down to the place of the dead [where God would punish them]. They would not be taken up [by God/God's angels] to heaven where God lives. (15)
\tqe Key Term Check: If the language of the translation has a traditional name for the place of the dead, that name can be used. Here it refers to a place which is the opposite of heaven and all for which it stands. See "Hades" in KBT in the "hell, Hades, abyss" entry.
\bttq What do you think was the reason those people might have expected that God would take them to heaven?
\tqe Jesus had indicated that he had done miracles in Capernaum (4:23).
\tqe He had taught in the synagogue there and driven out the evil spirit from a man (4:31-44).
\tqe He had healed the Roman army officer's servant there (7:1-10).
\an (Note: We know from the other gospel writers that Jesus lived there [Matt. 4:13; John 2:12],
\an taught about the Kingdom of God there [Matt. 4:17; John 6:24, 59-64],
\an and healed the paralytic man there [Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26].
\an The people of Capernaum may have thought that God would give them special treatment because Jesus had done all these things in their town, but they had not believed Jesus' message.)
\bttq To whom was Jesus talking in verse 16?
\tqe He was speaking to the 72 disciples he was sending out, not to the people of Capernaum.
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason why the people who did not accept his disciples would receive great punishment?
\tqe The disciples were preaching the same message as Jesus, so when the people accepted them, it was the same as though they were receiving the one who sent them, Jesus.  When they rejected what the disciples' said, they were rejecting Jesus and his Father who had sent him. [By rejecting Jesus' disciples they were rejecting God's plan for them, so God would reject them. They could not be saved any other way.]  (16)

\rf Luke 10:17-24 The 72 disciples returned in joy and Jesus also rejoiced.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 10.17-24
\bttq What were the 72 disciples rejoicing about?
\tqe When they used Jesus' name, even the demons obeyed them [to leave people]./God had given them power even over demons. (17)
\bttq What was the real reason that they should rejoice?
\tqe It was that their names were recorded [by God] in heaven where he lives. (20)
\bttq About what was Jesus rejoicing?
\tqe God had chosen to give his wisdom and power to these un-schooled, unsophisticated, but obedient, men. (21)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 10.17-20
\bttq What did the 72 disciples say when they returned to Jesus?
\tqe They said that even the demons obeyed them [to leave people] when they (the disciples) used the authority of Jesus' name. (17)
\bttq What other work had they done besides casting out demons from people?
\tqe They had healed the sick and preached the Good News about the kingdom of God. (10:9)
\an (Note: The words of the disciples implied that the power over demons was more than what they had expected. Luke recorded only that Jesus had given them power over sickness and authority to preach. Jesus had not explained the full range of the authority he had given them until after they had returned [see vs. 19]. Their sensing that demons obeyed them was more than they had expected. That sensing of the disciples should be expressed appropriately in the translation.)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that it was important that the disciples used Jesus' name when they did that work?
\tqe The name of Jesus had/held all the power and authority that Jesus had given to them. They had no personal power or authority greater than the demons' power. The power and authority was only theirs because Jesus had given it to them. (Because Jesus was the son of God, the demons also had to obey what his representatives said that Jesus wanted them to do.)
\bttq How did Jesus respond to the disciples' excitement?
\tqe He said that he had seen Satan fall from heaven [where spirit beings live] just as a bolt of lightning flashes [instantly] from the sky to the earth. (18)
\bttq Who is Satan?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is a spirit being who is the chief enemy of God and of those who believe in God's Son, Jesus. (See "Satan" in KBT.)
\an (Note: It is more important to use a term which gives the right understanding of who Satan is, rather than imply that "Satan" is only a personal name.)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant by his response to the disciples?
\an (Note: Any answer that does not contradict what men wrote in the rest of the Bible is acceptable. The Greek words do not clearly indicate whether Jesus was referring to the time when the disciples had been casting out demons or to a time before the world began. The disciples had seen Satan's demons obey their commands in Jesus' name. Jesus told them that he had seen Satan himself have to leave heaven immediately at God's command.)
\tqe [In his spirit] he had seen Satan's control of people end each time the disciples [preached, healed, or] cast out a demon in Jesus' name. Satan truly was defeated.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus had actually seen God cast Satan out of heaven before the world began, so the disciples' comments only confirmed that truth and were a sign of it.
\bttq What other examples did Jesus give to the disciples of how they might use the authority he had given to them?
\tqe They would be able to walk on snakes and scorpions (19)
\an and to overcome all the power of the enemy. (19)
\an Nothing would hurt them [when they were serving as Jesus' representatives]. (19)
\bttq Who do you think was the enemy to whom Jesus referred? (19)
\tqe Satan was that enemy.
\bttq What was a more important reason for the disciples to rejoice than that demons obeyed them?
\tqe It was more important that [God] had recorded their names in heaven. (20)
\an (Note: The Greek word that introduces verse 20 shows clearly that Jesus was going to say something different from what the disciples expected him to say. The translation should also show that change in the way that the speakers of that language usually show that.)
\bttq What do you think this picture language about writing names down means? (20)
\tqe It means that God knew that those disciples believed in Jesus as the savior he had sent. He knew that they were members in his kingdom and that he would allow them to enter heaven. They belonged there.
\tqref LUK 10.21-24
\bttq Who caused Jesus to be joyful?
\tqe The Holy Spirit did. (21)
\bttq For what did Jesus thank his father, God?
\tqe He thanked God that he (God) had hidden these things from those people who [thought that they] were wise and had learned much. He had done that in order that those people would not understand those things. (21)
\bttq What do you think those things were that God had hidden from the people who thought that they were wise and had learned much?
\tqe They were the things the disciples had learned about having authority as a follower of Jesus.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It was the knowledge the disciples had that their names were recorded already by God in heaven.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe When they had seen God's power at work as they served Jesus, they knew that the kingdom of God had already come.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Satan truly was defeated and his workers had to obey Jesus' followers. God's plan for sending a savior had happened already.
\an (Note: The Greek text does not point back clearly to any one particular thing when it says, "these things".)
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he said that little children had seen/understood things that God had hidden from others?
\tqe He was referring to his disciples who were ordinary, working people, not religious scholars. They were humble and willing to believe what he told them, not proud of their learning or stubborn.
\bttq What do you think it was that God had been pleased to do? (21)
\tqe He had hidden his plan from those who thought that they were wise and now had revealed it to those who were like little children in comparison [and they had believed it].
\bttq Listen to verse 22 again and then tell me to whom Jesus was speaking. Do you think that he was speaking at this point to his father or to all the people around him?
\tqe He was speaking then to those people who were around him, not to God.
\an (Note: The translation may need to make that change of hearer clear for the reader/listener.)
\bttq God had given some understanding, power and authority to those 72 disciples. What did Jesus say God had given to him?
\tqe All knowledge, power and authority had been given to him by [God] his father. (22)
\bttq Who did Jesus say will really know who God is and who his son is?
\tqe Only [God] the Father really knows who his son really is,
\tqe and only [Jesus] the son and those [people] to whom he chooses to reveal him know who [God] the Father really is, that is, what his true nature is like. (22)
\bttq To whom, do you think, does Jesus choose to reveal more understanding about who God is and what he is like?
\tqe He chooses to reveal more understanding to all those who believe in Jesus as God's son who came into the world to save us as God had promised.
\bttq To whom was Jesus speaking in verse 23?
\tqe He was speaking only to his disciples.
\bttq Whom did Jesus say should feel happy/blessed by God?
\tqe [God] had blessed those [people] who had seen what those disciples had seen. (23)
\bttq What had the disciples seen?
\tqe They had seen Jesus, the Messiah, God's son, bring the Good News that they could be in the kingdom of God. They had also seen Jesus use his authority and power to help people. Now as Jesus' representatives to different places, they had been able to do the same as Jesus had done.
\bttq Who had wanted to see these things which the disciples had seen, and hear what they had heard, but had not been able to do so?
\tqe Many prophets and kings had wished that they could have seen and heard what the disciples experienced [while Jesus taught them]. (24)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that those prophets and kings had not seen or heard the things that the disciples had?
\tqe Those prophets and kings had died many, many years before Jesus was born on the earth.

\rf Luke 10:25-37 Jesus told a parable about a Samaritan man who showed mercy.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 10.25-37
\bttq How did what Jesus believed and taught about receiving the eternal life compare with what the Jewish expert in the Law understood about it from the Law of Moses?
\tqe Jesus told the man to do the very same thing that the man had said that Moses had written in the books of the Law. [He had to do what the Law said, not just know what it said.] (26-28)
\bttq How does a person get eternal life?
\tqe Jesus said that we are to love and obey God [perfectly], according to his commands that Moses wrote down. This included loving our neighbor perfectly, too. (26-27)
\an (Note: Every person who tries to do as Jesus said soon finds that he cannot do it all perfectly and will never get eternal life by his own efforts. The only way left is to trust in Jesus' perfect life and in his death so that God could forgive our sins. Thus, eternal life is a gift from God.)
\bttq What is the answer to the expert's second question, "Who is my neighbor?"
\tqe A person's neighbor is anyone/everyone who needs our help in any way. (36-37)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 10.25-29
\bttq What did the expert in the Law want to know about eternal life?
\tqe He wanted to know what he had to do so that he could receive/inherit that life. (25)
\bttq What kind of life do you think that eternal life is?
\tqe Key Term Check: Eternal life is a life that is not affected by time limits, such as whether a person is still alive physically or not. That kind of living can begin now while we are still alive and will go on forever, even after our bodies die. Jesus, in his dying and rising on our behalf, made it possible for us to have that eternal life. God graciously and freely allows us to have that new life. It is a life of having a close relationship with God, obeying him as he rules over us. (See "life" in KBT.)
\bttq Why was that expert in the Law asking that question?
\tqe He wanted to test Jesus, [whether he really knew about God's laws and how to interpret them or not. He may have hoped to make Jesus appear wrong in front of the other people]. (25)
\bttq What did Jesus ask the man to tell him?
\tqe He asked the man to tell him what [Moses] had written [about eternal life] in the Law. (26)
\bttq What had Moses said that people should do to receive eternal life?
\tqe A person should love God with every part of him and then love his neighbor as [much as, or in the same way as, he loves] himself. (27)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek word for "heart" referred to the physical organ in the chest which pumps blood around the body. The word also referred to the center of a person's feelings, desires, and emotions. This verse refers to the heart as the center of emotions. The translation should use the term for whatever body part the culture says is that center of emotions, not necessarily the word for the heart. See "heart" in KBT.
\tqe Key Term Check: See 1:46-48, above, for comments on "soul". Also see "soul" in KBT.
\bttq What did Jesus say about the expert's answer?
\tqe He had answered correctly. If he did that, he would have [eternal] life. (28)
\bttq Jesus had answered the expert's first question completely. Why did the expert in the Law ask Jesus another question about this topic?
\tqe He wanted to justify himself, that is, he wanted to show that he was doing the right thing by his wanting to clearly understand how to get eternal life. (29)

\tqe He wanted to show that he was right in the way that he had been living and treating people. (29)

\bttq How did Jesus answer the expert's question about whom a person should regard as his neighbor?
\tqe He told the man a parable. (30-35)

\tqe Robbers attacked him. (30)
\tqe They took all his clothes. (30)
\tqe They beat him. (30)
\tqe They left him [lying there on the road] like a dead man/nearly dead. (30)
\bttq Did anyone else walk along that road?
\tqe Yes, a priest and, later, a man from the tribe/clan of Levi [who worked in the temple] [and even later, a Samaritan man,] each came along that road. (31-32)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "Levite" in KBT.
\an (Note: The first words in the Greek text in 10:31 indicate that the priest [and other people] did not often come along that road, so the injured man could have died there before another person found him and helped him. It would be good if the translation indicated that another person might not come along that part of the road until a long time after the robbers had beaten the man. See other translations for ideas.)
\bttq What did the priest do when he saw the injured man?
\tqe He passed by on the other/the far side of the road [and did not help the man]. (31)
\bttq What did the man from the tribe of Levi do when he saw that man?
\tqe He did the same as the priest had done, that is, he walked along the other side of the road as he passed the man without helping him. (32)
\tqref LUK 10.33-35
\bttq Who else came along that road to Jericho?
\tqe A Samaritan man came. (33)
\bttq What did the Samaritan man do when he saw the injured man?
\tqe He felt very sorry for the man [and wanted to help him]. (33)
\tqe He went up to the injured man, (34)
\tqe poured [olive] oil and wine on his wounds (34)
\tqe  and bandaged them. (34)
\tqe Then he put/placed the man on his own donkey (34)
\tqe and took him to an inn/hotel. (34)
\tqe There he took care of the [injured] man. (34)
\bttq What kind of oil do you think it was that the Samaritan man put on the other man's wounds?
\tqe It was juice from the fruit of the olive tree.
\bttq What did that Samaritan man do the next day when he left that inn?
\tqe He took out some money (two coins made of silver) and gave it to the owner of the inn to pay for whatever that injured man needed. (35)
\tqref LUK 10.36-37
\bttq Which man did the expert in the Law say was acting like a neighbor to the man who had been robbed?
\tqe The man who had mercy on him was the one who acted like a neighbor. (37)
\an (Note: If the assistant answers with, "The Samaritan", skip over the next question.)
\an (Note: Because of the bad feelings between the Jews and the Samaritans, this very religious Jew who was asking Jesus the question about eternal life and one's neighbor would not give credit out loud even to a Samaritan in a story by saying his nationality by name. He only described him by the good thing he did. If the language of the translation has a way to refer to a socially ostracized person or group, such as traditional enemies, see if that is an appropriate term for this expert to use here.)
\bttq Which man was that? The priest or the man from the tribe of Levi or the Samaritan?
\tqe The Samaritan was the one who had mercy.
\bttq What did Jesus tell the expert in the Law to do since he understood correctly which man had been the best neighbor?
\tqe He was to do just the same [as the Samaritan had done in showing mercy]. (37)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 10.38-42
\bttq What do you think that we should learn for ourselves from this incident?
\tqe We should be like Mary and choose to do what is most important in life. That is, we should stop being too busy with good activities which we think are important, and learn about God and how he wants us to live.
\dh Details
\bttq Luke wrote that these things happened "while Jesus and his disciples were on their way." Where were they headed?
\tqe They were going to Jerusalem.
\an (Note: See the answers and Note back at 9:51.)
\bttq Where did they stop along the way?
\tqe They stopped at the home of Martha [and her sister Mary]. (38-39)
\bttq What did Mary do while Jesus was at their house?
\tqe She sat at his feet listening to what he said. (39)
\bttq What did Martha do while Jesus was there?
\tqe She was very busy/upset with getting everything ready to feed and care for Jesus. (40)
\bttq While Martha was very busy, how did she feel about her sister Mary only sitting down?
\tqe She was upset. She asked Jesus if it didn't bother him that Mary was not helping her get things ready. (40)
\an (Note: The Greek words clearly show that Martha was upset and frustrated. The translation should show that, too in an appropriate way.)
\bttq What did Martha want Jesus to do about this problem?
\tqe She wanted him to tell Mary to help her. (40)
\bttq What did Jesus say about Martha?
\tqe He said that she was worried about many things, but only one thing was really needed/important. (42)
\bttq What was that one important thing?
\tqe What Mary had chosen to do was the more important thing. She had chosen to learn from Jesus. (42)
\an (Note: Some Bible scholars say that the "one thing" referred to Martha preparing less food and thus having less work. Then it would have been easy enough for one person to get ready quickly and also have time to hear what Jesus had to say.)
\bttq Do the words of Jesus in verses 41-42 sound like he was angry with Martha?
\tqe (It should not sound like he was angry. He was chiding/correcting her, but he was gentle and sympathetic to Martha's desire to show her love to him.)
\bttq Do you think that Jesus told Mary to stop listening and to go help Martha?
\tqe No. (42)

\rf Luke 11:1-13 Jesus taught his disciples how they should pray.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 11.1-13
\bttq Who was the example whom the disciples wanted to follow in the way that they prayed?
\tqe Jesus was their example. (1)
\bttq Who do you think is the best example for us to follow when we want to know how to pray?
\tqe Jesus is. (All that is recorded in the Bible about Jesus praying and what he taught about praying is the starting point for how, when, and where we are to pray meaningfully to God.)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted his disciples to learn about praying from the story he told about a man asking a neighbor for some food? (5-8)
\tqe They must come with their needs at any time and persevere/be persistent in praying.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe If even an unwilling human friend can be moved to act by a person who is persistent in his request for a need, how much more will God be moved by the persistence of one who prays to him for a need.
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted his disciples to learn about praying from the examples he gave about a human father responding to his son's request for help? (11-13)
\tqe God, our Father in heaven, is ready to hear our prayers and answer them even more than a human father would respond to his children's requests.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 11.1-4
\bttq What did one of Jesus' disciples ask him to do for them?
\tqe He asked Jesus to teach them [how/what] to pray. (1)
\bttq How should a person who is praying address the one to whom he is praying, that is, God?
\tqe He should address him as/call him "Father". (2)
\bttq What was the first thing Jesus said to God in this prayer?
\tqe He said that he wanted to honor/revere God's name more as being holy.
\tqe -AND/OR-
\tqe He said that he wanted God's name to be honored/revered as being holy [by more and more people]. (2)
\bttq How is it possible, do you think, that a name can be holy?
\tqe It is holy because it is part of the person who is holy./A person's name reflects what that person is like.
\bttq What should a person pray about God ruling in people's lives? (2)
\tqe One should pray that the time for God to rule over his people should come [soon/quickly].
\tqe -AND/OR-
\tqe God's rule should come/happen to all people. // All people should submit to God ruling over them. // May all people know/acknowledge God as their king.
\an (Note: The language of the translation may not allow an abstract object, such as a kingdom, to "come". Ask about this if the text appears to be a literal translation.)
\bttq If God is not ruling over some people, who do you think is ruling over them?
\tqe The devil is ruling them./Satan is ruling them.
\an (Note: A person may think that he is ruling/guiding himself, but that is not true. If God is not ruling, then that person has allowed himself to be under Satan's control.)
\bttq How/What should a person pray about his food?
\tqe He should ask God to help him get what he needs for that day. (3)
\an (Note: See the Note at 9:13 about "bread".)
\bttq What should a person pray about God forgiving his sins?
\tqe He should tell God that, because he is ready to forgive all other people who are indebted to him [in some way], he is ready to ask God to forgive him his sins. (4)
\bttq How does a person forgive another person who is indebted to him/who has sinned against him?
\tqe Key Term Check: He stops thinking about that person as having done something wrong against him. That means that there is no need for that person to compensate him in any way, such as by being punished or by giving him good things or by doing extra actions which would please him. The one who forgives does not think of that other person as being a bad person any longer. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\an (Note: This is the same thing that God does when he forgives a person [see 1:77]. If the speakers of the language used in the translation use a term for God forgiving people which is different from the term the people use for forgiving others, check what the people's reasons may be. This can be checked by switching the verbs for forgiveness and asking what makes each one acceptable or unacceptable in the people's minds. The Greek text uses the same word in both references. God expects us to do the same as he has done for us [Luke 6:37; Matt. 6:14-15; 18:32-35; Mark 11:25].)
\bttq What should a person pray about his being tempted to disobey God?
\tqe He should ask God to lead him in ways where Satan is not waiting to tempt him. // God should not permit him to enter into situations where Satan will tempt him to sin.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He should ask God not to allow him to do anything that day which would cause God to stop protecting him and, thus, leave him open to the devil's temptations. // He wants God to keep him living according to/submitting to God's perfect will/desires so that Satan has no way to control him.

\bttq In the story that Jesus told, what happened in the middle of the night?
\tqe A man went to his friend's house to borrow some food/three loaves of bread. (5)
\bttq Why did the man go there at that time of night?
\tqe Another friend who had traveled to visit him had arrived, and there was no food [in the house] to serve him. (6)
\bttq Why did the neighbor friend not want to open the door and give this man some food?
\tqe The door was locked/secured [and would be difficult or noisy to open and close again]. (7)
\tqe The man's children were in the [same] bed with him [and would wake up if the father got up and moved around]. (7)
\bttq Why did he finally get up and give the man who was standing outside all the food he needed?
\tqe Because the man who was outside was persistent/kept on asking him for the food, the neighbor gave him all that he needed. (8)
\bttq Whom, do you think, the man inside the house and the man who was standing outside represented in Jesus' story?
\tqe The man inside the house represented God,
\tqe and the man standing outside represented the disciples or anyone who requests God's help.
\tqref LUK 11.9-13
\bttq What did Jesus say that a person is to do if he needs something?
\tqe He is to keep on asking [God for it], seeking [for it] and knocking on God's door [because of it]. (9)
\an (Note: Most writers of commentaries mention that the three phrases convey a sense of increasing intensity to get whatever is needed, knocking on a door being the most intense. However, knocking may not be the normal way in the culture of the readers of this translation to show one's desire to interact with the people inside a neighbor's house. For help in adjusting the translation to be culturally appropriate, see TN, Luke 11:9c.)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that he told the disciples to pray in that manner?
\tqe Everyone who prays in that way receives or finds what they needed, or [God] opens his door, [and gives it to them]. (10)
\bttq What two examples did Jesus give of how a father would not treat a request from his son?
\tqe If his son asked for a fish, the father would not give him a snake instead. (11)
\tqe If his son asked for an egg, he would not give him a scorpion. (12)
\bttq How did Jesus compare his disciples with God?
\tqe He said that they were bad in contrast to God who is perfect. Even so, they gave good things to their children when they asked. God wants [and is ready] more than they to give perfect gifts, even his own Holy Spirit, to those people who will ask him. (13)

\rf Luke 11:14-23 Some people said that Jesus' power came from Satan.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 11.14-23
\bttq Jesus implied that what he had done by the power of God was to show/reveal something to the people. What should the people have understood?
\tqe Casting out the demon from a man was a sign that the kingdom of God had come to them/was happening among them [because Jesus was the one whom God had sent to save them]. (20)
\bttq How did Jesus' statements about the parts of a divided kingdom being against each other apply to what had just happened?
\tqe He was referring to what the people had been thinking when he cast out the demon. (18b) If he was one of Satan's workers, he would not cast another of Satan's workers out of a man. That would only weaken Satan's kingdom. Their thinking did not make sense.
\bttq People had responded to Jesus and his message in different ways. What did Jesus say about those different responses?
\tqe The people were either for him or against him. There was no middle/neutral choice. (23)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 11.14-16
\bttq What happened which started many people talking about Jesus' power?
\tqe Jesus was casting out a demon that made a man unable to talk/mute/dumb.
\tqe As the demon went out, the man [who had been] mute/dumb began to speak. (14)
\bttq How did most of the people who saw that react?
\tqe They were amazed. (14)
\an (Note: Luke already has used this same Greek word "thaumazw" eight times to describe people's reactions to things they saw or heard. Check again at 8:25 and 9:43 to see whether the translation has described this action consistently. Luke wrote that the same thing happened each time, so the translation should reflect that, too.)
\bttq How did some people react?
\tqe Some of them said that Jesus was using Beelzebub's/Beelzeboul's power. (15)
\bttq Who is Beelzebub/Beelzeboul?
\tqe He is the leader/ruler of the demons. (15)
\bttq What other name did Jesus use for this leader of the demons?
\tqe He used the name Satan. (18)
\bttq How did other people react?
\tqe They asked Jesus to show them a sign/miracle from [God in] heaven. They wanted to test him, [that is, to prove that his power and authority really were from God and not from Satan]. (16)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They asked Jesus to cause a sign/miracle to happen in the sky or to come from the sky. [Then they would know that God had sent him to do what he was doing.] (16)
\tqref LUK 11.17-20
\bttq What did Jesus say happens when the people in a kingdom or a house divide into groups and argue or fight against each other?
\tqe That kingdom or household loses its power and its unity and will be ruined/its power and influence will decrease greatly. (17)
\bttq How were the people, including Pharisees, to judge whether Jesus had used Satan's power or God's power to cast out that demon?
\tqe Since some of the Pharisees' own followers cast out the same kind of demons, the people should ask them if they used Satan's power to do that. (19) (Their own people would quickly show them that such an opinion about anyone, even Jesus, was wrong.)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "judge, judgment" in KBT.
\bttq If the translator used a figure of speech here about "God's finger" or "God's hand" or "God's arm", ask the following question:  To what do these words, "God's finger/hand/arm" refer in verse 20?
\tqe They refer to casting out the demon by God's power.

\tqref LUK 11.21-22
\bttq Jesus used picture language again to try to make his point clear to everyone. Tell me the example you just heard.
\tqe A strong man guards his possessions so they are safe. (21)
\tqe When someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, [the stronger man] takes everything which had protected that man and divides that man's possessions [among his own friends]. (22)
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he talked about those two strong men?
\tqe Jesus was referring to Satan as the strong man.
\tqe He was referring to himself as the stronger man who attacked.
\bttq To what, do you think, did the picture of Satan's possessions refer?
\tqe Satan's possessions were the people whom his demons controlled.
\bttq To what, do you think, did the weapons which Satan used refer?
\tqe Satan's weapons were the demons.
\bttq Jesus had just cast out a demon which had made a man unable to talk. What do you think was the way that relates to what Jesus said about robbing another person?
\tqe A robber must be stronger than the person he robs. Since Jesus had sent Satan's demons out of the man, then Jesus is clearly stronger than Satan. He overpowered Satan and won the victory.
\an (Note: Jesus had defeated Satan in the desert earlier [see 4:1-13]. Now he was taking away from Satan the people he had controlled. This was like taking away the things that Satan had owned. Jesus was giving out the benefits of his victory to the members of his own kingdom by freeing them from any demon's control.)
\tqref LUK 11.23
\bttq To what, do you think, did Jesus refer when he spoke about gathering and scattering something?
\tqe Jesus referred to gathering people [to follow him] into the kingdom of God. Satan does not want that to happen, so he does things to keep people out of God's kingdom.
\bttq Jesus had cast out the demon which had made a man unable to talk. What do you think was the way that relates to what Jesus said about gathering and scattering?
\tqe The people who had thought that Jesus had used Satan's power to cast out the demon were not helping Jesus [or encouraging others to come to him], but causing other people to stay away.

\bttq Who did the woman say was blessed/truly happy?
\tqe [Jesus' mother, being] the woman who had borne and breast-fed him was blessed/happy. (27)
\an (Note: The words which the woman spoke literally mean that the womb and the breasts were the things which were "blessed". She used the poetic pattern of her Hebrew/Aramaic language to express her meaning by using two parallel statements. The two statements together help us understand that the woman's focus was not on the body parts, but on the person to whom they belonged, Jesus' mother. The translation should reflect that focus, regardless whether it is culturally appropriate or not to speak about wombs and breast-feeding in a public gathering, such as a church service.)

\bttq Who did Jesus say were even more blessed/happier than his mother?
\tqe Those [people] who hear the word of God and do [what it says] are even happier. (28)
\an (Note: Jesus did not say that his mother was not blessed, but that these people would be even more blessed than his own mother. Actually, his mother's great happiness/blessing was because she had listened and obeyed God's word which the angel had spoken to her [1:38, 45; 2:51].)

\an (Note: The things which the people of Nineveh had seen in Jonah's life are named in Matthew's account of this event [Matt. 12:38-42]. Jonah's message was that the people had to repent or be punished. This was the same message which Jesus now preached. Also, Jonah had spent three days and three nights in the stomach of a great fish. It seemed that he had died when he had been thrown into the sea, but then it was as though he rose from the dead when that fish spit him up on the shore. Jesus implied that something similar would happen to him. Because his wisdom was greater than Solomon's and his message greater than Jonah's, the people already had enough reason to believe in him.)

\tqe He said that those people who were alive then as he spoke were wicked.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He said that the people to whom he was speaking were wicked. (29)
\bttq What did Jesus say was a sign to him that they were wicked?
\tqe They [kept on] asking for a sign (which they would say proved that he had been sent by God and had God's power in him). (29)
\bttq The people would see the same kind of sign as the people of Nineveh had seen when Jonah preached to them long ago. But how had the way that the Nineveh people responded to Jonah been different from the way that the people were now responding to Jesus?
\tqe The people of Nineveh had repented when Jonah preached [to them] (32), [but these people had not repented when Jesus preached to them].
\bttq What judgment do you think Jesus was talking about in verses 31 and 32? (Reread those two verses.)
\tqe Jesus referred to the time/Last Day when God will judge all the people of the world. (See 10:14.)
\bttq What will the people of Nineveh do when God later judges all the people of the world?
\tqe They will be raised [from the dead by God] and condemn/accuse [the people who lived at Jesus' time] because those people did not repent [of their sins]. (32)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They will stand up [as witnesses] and condemn/accuse [the people who heard Jesus preach] for not repenting [of their sins]. (32)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 11.33-36
\bttq What did Jesus try to teach the people by using this story about a lamp and its light and people's eyes?
\tqe The purpose of a lamp is to help people to see clearly when it is dark. God put Jesus on the earth to make the truths about [the kingdom of] God clear to those who believe the signs that God had sent him. Those clear truths will affect all areas of those believers' lives. The people who don't believe that about Jesus will not have a clear understanding even of the small amount of truth that they think they have.
\bttq What do you think those people should have realized right then in order that their whole lives would have God's truth in them? (36)
\tqe They should have realized that Jesus' words and work were showing God's truths to them. Only in believing and accepting that in their lives would they have clear understanding and direction in all that they thought and did.
\dh Details
\bttq Why do people light lamps?
\tqe People light lamps to give light so people can see when it is too dark otherwise. (33)
\bttq What does a person do with a lamp after he lights it?
\tqe He puts/places it where it can be useful, such as on a lamp holder. He does not hide it under anything. (33)
\bttq What part of our bodies did Jesus say is like a lamp?
\tqe He said that our eyes work as a lamp for our bodies. (34)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the way that a person's eyes work like a lamp?
\tqe Good eyes let in lots of light, so the person sees well.
\tqe But when eyes are bad, the person sees nothing/only darkness. (34)
\tqe -AND/OR-
\tqe Good eyes let in light and the whole body functions well.
\tqe When the eyes are bad, the whole body does not function well. (34)
\an (Note: The Greek words which Luke used for "good" and "bad" have two ways to be understood. One way is to understand them as evaluating physical things, like real eyes. The other way is to understand them as evaluating what God said about who Jesus was and how he wants us to live. Because this cannot all be included, generally, in the translated text, small footnotes or a glossary item may be needed to make both aspects of the meaning clear. The people who were listening to Jesus understood what he meant.)
\an (Note: Also see "darkness" described above at 1:79.)
\bttq (Read verse 35 again.) What hidden meaning, do you think, did Jesus want the people to understand from this?
\tqe Those people thought that they already had a clear understanding about God, but it really was not clear.
\tqe Actually, since they had not believed in Jesus, they real did not know God.
\an (Note: Using the figurative language of Jesus about light and darkness, we could say that because they did not have the light of Jesus in them, their lives were still in darkness.)

\tqe They should expect [that God would punish them by causing] horrible things to happen to them. (42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 50-51, 52)
\bttq What were the reasons that the experts in the Law should expect God to cause horrible things to happen to them also?
\tqe They made so many rules for the people, it was almost impossible to obey them all. The experts never helped/made it easier for the people to obey them, not even a little bit. (46)
\tqe They built tombs/special burial places for the prophets their own forefathers/ancestors had killed, and in that way showed that they approved of what their forefathers had done. Those experts in the Law were not honoring/obeying the prophets God sent them, [meaning John the Baptizer and Jesus,] any more than their forefathers had honored/obeyed God's prophets in their time.

\tqe (Note: It was as if they were honoring their forefathers for having killed the prophets, not that they were honoring the prophets. It was as if the only good prophet was a dead one.)
\tqe They had not shared with the people how to really know [God or God's plan for the Messiah to save them nor how to understand the Scriptures which pointed to the Messiah]. This kept those who [wanted to] enter [the kingdom of God/a proper relationship with God] from doing so, and even they themselves were not entering. (52)

\bttq What happened when Jesus had finished speaking about those things?
\tqe A Pharisee invited Jesus to eat with him. (37)
\bttq What did Jesus do that surprised the Pharisee?
\tqe Jesus did not first [ritually] wash before eating the [midday] meal. (38)
\bttq What did Jesus say about the Pharisees' concern about cleaning things?
\tqe They worried about [pleasing God by ritually] cleaning the outsides of [physical] things like plates and cups.
\tqe But at the same time, [they did not get rid of] their own bad thoughts and attitudes inside themselves [that did not please God]. (39)
\bttq What did Jesus say was inside those Pharisees that did not please God?
\tqe They were very greedy and very wicked. (39)
\an (Note: Jesus explained in Mark 7:15-23 about what should be regarded as clean or unclean in God's eyes. Both of the Greek words which name bad things here in verse 39 are also included in Mark's passage in a longer list of bad actions which come out of a person's heart and make him unclean.)
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he talked about the one who made the outside and the inside of people? (40)
\tqe He was referring to God.
\bttq Since God made all parts of a person, which parts, do you think, does God want that person to be most concerned about? (40)
\tqe Probably he wants people to be concerned about all parts, but especially the inside, [because that is where bad actions start].
\an (Note: The person who answers this question will probably name the specific part of the body which he regards as the place of emotions, thoughts or belief. That is a good answer. The translation should not be so general that hearers will think that Jesus contrasted the physical outside with the physical organs inside the abdomen.)
\bttq In verse 39 Jesus said that the Pharisees' (centers of emotions, thoughts or belief) were very greedy/full of greedy actions. What does he say that they should do to show that they were clean inside (that is, they were free from sin)?
\tqe They should give the things which will be in their hearts, [such as love and a desire to help] to the poor people. (They could do that by sharing their food or possessions with them.) (41)
\tqref LUK 11.42-44
\bttq What did Jesus say that the Pharisees should do about the tithes they had been giving?
\tqe He said that they should not stop tithing when they began to judge people fairly and to love God. (42b)
\bttq How, do you think, were the Pharisees like unmarked graves?
\tqe [They appeared to obey God, but they were hiding their bad attitudes and actions. In a spiritual sense] they were like dead bodies rotting inside graves of which people were not aware. The people around the Pharisees did not know that they were like that [in their hearts].
\an (Note: The Pharisees were contaminating those people by teaching them to follow the Pharisees' own bad example. See Num. 19:16 to read how a person became contaminated by stepping on a grave.) (44)
\bttq What were the reasons that the Pharisees should expect [that God will punish them by causing] horrible things to happen to them?
\tqe They were careful to give God one-tenth of every kind of little plant in their gardens, but they did not care at all about judging [others] fairly or loving God. (42a)
\an (Note: See 10:25-28 where these two things are agreed upon as being the two most important things God wants in a person's life.)
\tqe They loved to have [people] honor them when they were in public places, like the synagogue and marketplace. (43)
\tqe People [who thought that the Pharisees were good examples to follow in order to obey God] did not realize how bad/evil the Pharisees were on the inside, (that is, in their attitudes and actions). [In a spiritual sense] the Pharisees were dead and rotting. [That caused all the people who followed the Pharisees to become contaminated/unclean in God's eyes just as the Pharisees were.] (44)
\tqref LUK 11.45-52
\bttq How did one man respond to that powerful/strong talk of Jesus?
\tqe He told Jesus that he (Jesus) was insulting even his own group, who were the teachers of the Law [of Moses]. (45)
\an (Note: Those teachers said that they knew the most about what Moses wrote that God wanted in a person's life. The Pharisees made their own rules to help them live according to what these experts had said.)
\bttq Jesus used a word picture about "loading people down with burdens". If the translation contains that word picture, of what do you think that heavy load was a picture? (46)
\tqe The experts in the Law [of Moses] taught the people many of their own rules, thinking those rules would help people to obey God's rules.
\bttq Jesus also used a word picture about "lifting a finger" to do work. How much work do you think a person can do by using only one finger? (46)
\tqe A person cannot do any useful work by using only one finger.
\bttq How did Jesus apply that meaning to what the experts in the Law of Moses were doing?
\tqe They told the people to obey their many rules, but they did not help the people even a small amount [to obey them]. (46)
\bttq Even before God sent out his prophets and apostles, what did he know/say about how they would be treated by the Jews?
\tqe He knew that the Jews would kill some and persecute others. (49)

\tqe He knew that the Jews would kill and persecute some of them. (49)
\bttq What, do you think, did the Jews do when they persecuted some of God's prophets and apostles? (49)
\tqe Key Term Check: They oppressed and harassed the prophets and apostles on a regular basis for the purpose of having them suffer pain and frustration. (See L&N 39.45.)
\bttq Whom will God hold responsible for the prophets who had been killed by the Jews?
\tqe The generation of Jews who were living at the time that Jesus was living would be responsible. (50-51)
\bttq For which prophets will those Jews be punished by God?
\tqe God will punish them for all the prophets whom they and their forefathers had killed since the world was first made. (50-51)
\bttq Jesus used a word picture about a key. If the translation contains that word picture, to what do you think that Jesus referred when he spoke of  "the key of knowledge"? (52)
\tqe He referred to a correct understanding of their [Old Testament] scriptures, which would show the people that Jesus was the Messiah whom God had promised to send to them.
\tqe They would also see that they could then enter into a direct relationship with God, accepting his ruling and reigning over them [in the kingdom of God].

\bttq About what did Jesus warn his disciples?
\tqe He warned them about the hypocritical [actions and attitudes of the] Pharisees, which [would affect things like] yeast does. (1)
\bttq Tell me about yeast. (1)
\tqe Key Term Check: If yeast is mixed with water and honey or sugar it grows and ferments, causing air bubbles. If a person makes dough by adding flour to that mixture, the yeast will make that dough swell and increase in size.
\bttq What is hypocrisy?/What does a person do who is a hypocrite?
\tqe Key Term Check: A hypocritical person pretends to believe or do that which other people will approve or that for which other people praise him. He does not do it because he really believes that what he does is right or good.
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen to the things the Pharisees or others had covered up or hidden?
\tqe Their secrets would be uncovered/disclosed and made known [to others]. // [God] would uncover/ disclose them, making [it possible for other people] to know about them. (2)
\bttq How did Jesus explain this further to his disciples?
\tqe What they had said in some dark [place or time] would be heard out in the daylight, [that is, out in the open for all to hear]. (3)

\bttq Whom should the disciples fear?
\tqe They should fear him who could kill their bodies and who also has authority to throw them into hell. (5)
\bttq What kind of a place is hell?
\tqe Key Term Check: Hell is a place of punishment for all people who disobey God. It is pictured as a place where fire always burns and it is separated from where God lives. (See "hell" in KBT in the "hell, Hades, abyss" entry.)
\bttq Who do you think the person is whom they should fear?
\tqe He is God. Only God has that power and authority.
\bttq What two examples did Jesus tell the disciples in order to show that God cared for them?
\tqe God does not forget about each [little] sparrow which, when it is sold, it is worth only a very, very small amount of money. (6)
\tqe God even knows each and every hair on a person's head. (7)

\tqe Jesus will disown/deny him before God's angels [that that person belongs to him]. (9)
\bttq Jesus said that there was a serious sin which could be forgiven and one which could not be forgiven. What were those two sins?
\tqe Everyone who says something disrespectful/evil/bad about the Son of Man, Jesus, can be forgiven [by God],
\tqe but a person who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven [by God]. (10)
\tqe Key Term Check: See the comments on "blaspheme" at 5:21.

\tqe The Holy Spirit would teach them at that time what they should say. (12)

\rf Luke 12:13-21 Jesus told a parable about a foolish man who stored up wealth for himself.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 12.13-21
\bttq Jesus warned the people who were listening to him to be on their guard against something. What was it?
\tqe They must protect themselves from all the ways of being greedy, that is, desiring to possess more and more money and things. They should not become like that. (15)
\bttq Tell me the parable that Jesus told about a greedy man.
\tqe A rich man's land produced a good crop of grain/wheat.
\tqe He wanted to keep all of it, but his storage buildings were too small.
\tqe He decided to take down the old buildings and put up larger ones.
\tqe He boasted to himself that his many good things would take care of him for many years.
\tqe Therefore, now he could have feasts and enjoy himself and not worry about working hard any more.
\tqe But God said that man was foolish to think only about himself and his future when he did not know that he was about to die that night.
\tqe Others would use all those things he had saved for himself. (16-20)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen to anyone who is selfish and greedy?
\tqe God will judge those people who are selfish, holding on to the things they possess [and do not share them].
\tqe He may make them die to show how foolish all their selfish work was. [Anyone who thinks only of his many possessions and does not think how to please God, will perish/will not have eternal life.] (21)
\bttq What did Jesus say a person should do instead of being greedy/selfish with the things he has?
\tqe Instead of trying to become rich with the things that make him happy,
\tqe a person should greatly enjoy using his money and abilities to do what pleases God. (21)
\bttq What do you think are ways that a person could greatly enjoy using his money and abilities to do what pleases God? (21)
\tqe He should first obey God and then use his material wealth in Christian love and compassion. He should try to relieve the needs of others in his family, in the family of believers, and among others. He should do it for God's glory, not his own.

\bttq What did Jesus say about how a person should think about the things he possesses?

\rf Luke 12:22-34 Do not worry about the things you need.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 12.22-34
\bttq Why were Jesus' disciples not to worry about eating to stay alive and covering their bodies with clothing?
\tqe Being alive has more important aspects than worrying about [having enough] food.
\tqe Their bodies were also more important than what clothes they would wear on them. (23)
\bttq From all that Jesus had just said about the foolish rich man in verses 16-20, what do you think makes such worrying about one's food and clothes bad?
\tqe When a person worries, he thinks about only himself and what he wants, not about God and what he wants for us (28b, 34). It also has no lasting value (26, 33).
\bttq About what should a disciple or follower of Jesus be thinking and on what should he focus his life instead of worrying about food and clothing?
\tqe He should seek ways for God to rule and reign in his life and in the lives of others. Then [God] will provide those things [as the person needs them]. (31)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe When he allows God to rule in his life, God will provide whatever he needs to live, so he should not worry about those things. (31)
\bttq Since God has been pleased already to give blessings related to his kingdom/his ruling over us and providing for us, what should the people who are in God's kingdom do?
\tqe They should think more about using their possessions to help people who are in need, and think less about keeping things safe for themselves. When they help others, it is as though they are putting treasure in heaven to use and enjoy later. Their focus will be on pleasing God, not themselves. (33-34)

\bttq How were the ravens to be an example for Jesus' disciples?
\tqe They do not sow/plant [seeds] or reap/harvest [what they had sown/planted], and they do not have special places in which to store [extra food so they could use it later]. Even so, God provides food for them. (24a)
\bttq Since God does that for birds, which do not get ready for the dry time/cold time when no new food will grow, what should that show to the disciples?
\tqe It shows that God will provide them with at least all their basic needs. (24b)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It shows that God will do more for them because they are worth much more [to him] than the birds. (24b)
\bttq How much longer did Jesus say that a person can make himself live just by worrying about it?
\tqe He said that a person cannot make himself live even one hour longer. (25)
\bttq Which part of a person's life can worrying about it help?/How does it help a person to worry?
\tqe No part of a person's life is helped./Worrying does not help in any way. (26)
\tqref LUK 12.27-31
\bttq What example did Jesus use next to teach his disciples not to worry?
\tqe He told about the wild flowers/lilies. (27)
\bttq How are the wild flowers to be an example for them?
\tqe They do not do any kind of work, but God makes them very beautiful anyway. Not even [ancient King] Solomon in all his beautiful clothes ever dressed as beautifully as one wild flower (27).
\an (Note: The two kinds of work which Jesus named referred specifically to general physical labor, such as Jewish men did, and to the twisting of fibers into thread/yarn/string, which Jewish women did. If the culture of the translation has similar roles which divide the work of men and women, or if it has two other work roles to which they traditionally refer as indicating men and women, do try to use one of those divisions here.)
\bttq If God does that for the wild flowers which are alive only a very short time, what should that have shown to the disciples?
\tqe It should have shown that God would provide them with at least all their basic needs. (28)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It should have shown that God would do even more for them because they would have a longer, lasting purpose than the flowers (28).
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus compared the beauty of the wild flowers to Solomon?
\tqe Solomon had been king of Israel a long time before Jesus lived. God made him the richest man in all the world. He could buy any beautiful clothing or jewelry that he wanted. Even so, God made the wild flowers more beautiful than King Solomon had ever been.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus called his disciples "men of little faith"? (28b)
\tqe Since God is so caring and generous with insignificant [birds and] flowers, his own followers' worries must show their lack of faith/trust in God's ability or interest to provide for them. (28)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The heathen/pagan people [who do not have a relationship with God] worry about/focus their lives on all such things. (30)

\tqe Jesus called his disciples a little flock of sheep.
\bttq How might the disciples be like a little flock of sheep which did not need to worry?
\tqe By themselves they could become lost and in danger without a shepherd, but [God,] their Father, was watching out for them and had been pleased to provide [them with his] kingdom/what they needed spiritually. He would provide their physical needs, as well. (32)
\bttq What did Jesus tell his disciples to do which would show that they were not worrying about the things they needed every day?
\tqe They should sell what they possessed and give [the money] to the poor [people]. (33a)
\bttq Instead of a person who follows Jesus valuing and gathering earthly possessions/treasures, what should he be valuing and gathering?
\tqe He should gather things having great value in heaven where they will never lose their value. He should not gather things like money which falls out of a purse when it wears out and has holes in it. No thief will steal those things in heaven and no moth will destroy those things by eating holes in them. They will last forever. (33)
\bttq What did Jesus say made this matter so very important to God?
\tqe What a person regards as very important will be the thing on which he focuses his thoughts and desires. If the focus of a person's heart is on earthly things, God will know that person is not focusing on him. A person should value pleasing God, not pleasing himself. (34)

\tqref LUK 12.57-59
\bttq What lesson did Jesus try to teach the people in these verses?
\tqe He urged people to make peace with other people and with God before they must pay the penalty for their doing wrong. If they do not make peace, they might be punished and never be free again. (58-59)
\dh Details
\bttq What did Jesus advise his listeners to do?
\tqe They should decide what is right on their own. (57)
\bttq What picture language did Jesus use here?
\tqe He used the picture of one person taking another to the court to settle a dispute, apparently over money. If the person who has/owes the debt does not straighten the problem quickly, he may be thrown into the jail and be forced to stay there. (58-59)
\bttq What did Jesus imply was the right thing to do?
\tqe The person being taken to the judge/court should admit that he did wrong to his accuser/ opponent and work hard to settle the problem quickly. (58)
\bttq What if the problem is not settled before facing a leader/ruler/judge?
\tqe What the judge decides will be final, and that probably will mean that the person would be confined somewhere, like a jail. (58)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the only way for that person to get out of the jail?
\tqe He could get out only if he paid back everything, including the last small part [of the debt] which he owed. (59)
\bttq Does it sound to you as though it is possible to pay the money back while you are in jail, if you did not have it to pay back before you went into jail?
\tqe No, it probably is not possible.
\bttq If this picture language is referring to God as our judge, and we stand before him and have not repented, what did Jesus imply would happen to us?
\tqe [God] will put us into Hell and we will never get/come out.

\tqe -OR-
\tqe He warned them that unless they repented, they also would perish/die/be destroyed [by God]. (3, 5)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "destroy, perish, (be lost" in KBT. Although the same Greek word was used in 5:37, 8:24 and 11:51 in non-spiritual contexts, the language of the translation may not allow that earlier translation to be used here to mean the total destruction of spiritual things.)

\bttq What did some people in the crowd with Jesus tell him?
\tqe Some [Jews] from Galilee [province] had been killed by [the Roman governor] Pilate['s soldiers] while they were offering sacrifices [to God within the temple grounds], and their blood mixed with [the blood of] their sacrifices. (1)
\bttq What did Jesus imply as to how the people seemed to regard that terrible act?
\tqe They seemed to have thought that God had punished those people because they had sinned more [than the rest of the people]. (2)
\bttq What was the similar example which Jesus himself wanted the people to think about?
\tqe Eighteen people had been killed/had died when a tower at Siloam [in Jerusalem] fell on them. Jesus did not want the people to also think that those people had died because they were greater/worse sinners than the other people who lived in Jerusalem. (4)
\bttq What did Jesus say about that as being the reason that all those people had died in each of those troubles?
\tqe He said strongly, "No, [that is not right]." (3, 5)

\rf Luke 13:6-9 Jesus told a parable about a fig tree that produced no fruit.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 13.6-9
\bttq (Read 13:5 again.) What do you think was the way that Jesus wanted the people to understand the meaning of this parable after just having talked to them about repenting?
\tqe The way that a man judges a fruit tree is the same way that God will judge a person's life.
\tqe If people do not repent and begin doing what pleases God, then they also are of no value to him and he will destroy them.
\dh Details
\bttq Where had the man planted this fig tree?
\tqe He planted it in his vineyard/grape garden. (6)
\bttq What did the man see when he went to find fruit on that tree?
\tqe He did not find any [fruit there]. (6)

\tqe He had come for three years. (7)
\bttq Why did he tell the man who took care of his garden to cut down that tree?
\tqe The tree was using [valuable] space and/or plant food/nourishment which were/was in the ground. (7)

\tqe He used God's power over Satan (13, 16) and [other] spirits (11-12).
\tqe He had compassion on people who needed help, regardless of which day it was. (11-12, 14)
\tqe -AND/OR-
\tqe He had power from God which showed his authority over rules and regulations made by men. (16)
\bttq What does this event show us about some of the Jews' religious leaders?
\tqe They did not believe that Jesus' power and teaching showed that he was the one God had sent to be the Messiah or savior. Because they did not believe that he had any authority from God over spiritual things, they also did not believe that he had any authority to disobey their rules about the Sabbath Day.

\bttq What was wrong with one woman who was in the synagogue?
\tqe She had been crippled for eighteen years./She was bent over and could not straighten up. (11)

\bttq What made the ruler of the synagogue angry?
\tqe It was the Sabbath Day, but Jesus had healed [the woman anyway]. (14)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that made him angry?
\tqe The Jewish leaders had said that was work, and God had said that no one was to work on the Sabbath Day. (See Exod. 20:9 and Deut. 5:13.)
\bttq What did the ruler say to the people?
\tqe He said that they should come on one of the other six days [of the week when it was right to work] and be healed then. (14)
\bttq What did Jesus call this man and the others who felt the same way?
\tqe He called them hypocrites. (15)
\bttq What reason did Jesus give for calling the synagogue leaders hypocrites?
\tqe They untied their oxen and donkeys [which had been tied only a short time] on the Sabbath to walk around and get water to drink, but they did not want [Jesus on the Sabbath] to set free this woman who had been bound (i.e., controlled) by the devil for 18 years. (15-16)
\an (Note: If the leaders thought that God cared about how they treated their animals on the Sabbath Day, then he surely cared much more about one of his chosen people. The synagogue leaders considered healing to be work. Jesus pointed out that caring for their animals also was work! Therefore they were hypocrites regarding not working on the Sabbath.)
\bttq What was the woman's relationship to Abraham? (16)
\tqe Jesus called her Abraham's daughter. That meant she was a descendant of the Jew's ancestor Abraham.
\bttq How did the different groups of people react to what Jesus had said and done?
\tqe Those men who had opposed Jesus were humiliated/ shamed.
\tqe The [other] people rejoiced at all the wonderful/splendid things Jesus was doing. (17)

\tqe In the end, the kingdom of God would affect everyone and be a place of rest for many people. (19b, 21b)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 13.18-19
\bttq To what did Jesus compare the kingdom of God?
\tqe To a seed of the mustard tree/plant. (19)
\an (Note: If the mustard tree/plant is not part of the local culture, the translation does not have to say that the seed is from that specific plant. It should, however, definitely refer to some very small seed that the people know will grow into a strong plant.
\an If the mustard tree/plant is used in the translation, deciding whether to call it a "tree" or a "plant" will depend on the way that the culture classifies all the growing things.)
\bttq Tell me about that seed.
\tqe The seed is very tiny, but it grows into a large, strong tree/plant with branches. Birds make nests/places to rest in it. (19)
\bttq What happened to the tiny seed in Jesus' story?/What did that tiny seed do?
\tqe A man threw it into his garden and it grew there, became a tree/a plant as tall as a tree, and birds made nests/places to rest in its branches. (19)

\tqe He compared the kingdom of God to yeast. (21)
\an (Note: See 12:1 above.)
\bttq What happened to the yeast in Jesus' story?
\tqe A woman added the yeast to a mixture of much flour [and a smaller amount of liquid].  (21)
\bttq What do you think the yeast did to the dough when it was mixed in well?
\tqe It caused all the dough to swell/increase in size.

\tqe Only those people who had come through the narrow door/the correct way (24) before the door was shut (25) were allowed to enter. The others were told to leave. (27)
\bttq What do you think that the narrow door is a picture of?
\tqe Jesus meant that there is only one small way to enter the kingdom of God. (Perhaps it referred to repenting of one's sins as being the only way to enter the kingdom of God). (24)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus meant that there are not many opportunities left to enter the kingdom of God, so they must do so quickly. (25)

\tqe Many [people] will try to enter. (24)
\bttq How many people will enter?
\tqe Not many will enter./Not nearly as many will enter as tried to enter. (24)
\bttq To whom, do you think, did the owner of the house in the parable really refer?
\tqe He referred to Jesus.
\an (Note: Jesus is understood to be the owner, rather than God, his father. That comes from other times when Jesus spoke of the banquet/feast as a wedding feast in which he is the bridegroom. It can also be implied from verse 25 in the passive verb "has been raised/has risen".)
\bttq What will people do after Jesus closes the door of the kingdom?
\tqe People will stand on the outside knocking and asking the Lord to open the door for them. (25)
\bttq What will Jesus answer them?
\tqe He will say he did not know them or where they had come from. (He had no close association or relationship with them.) (25)
\bttq How will those people who are outside the kingdom try to show that they thought that they had a relationship with Jesus?

\bttq Where will the people who are at the feast in the kingdom of God come from?
\tqe They will come from all the directions/parts of the world, (east, west, north, and south) [where the Gentiles/the non-Jews live]. (29)
\bttq Who do you think are the people whom Jesus said were last, but will be first in the kingdom of God? (30)
\tqe Some of the people from all over the world [who are not Jews, or who are not important in ways that the world thinks is important, or who hear last about Jesus as their savior].
\bttq Who do you think are the people whom Jesus said were first, but would be last in the kingdom of God? (30)
\tqe Some of the Jews [who thought that God would automatically allow them to enter because they were descendants of Abraham]. (God had said that they were his special people. They also had been the first culture to hear the Good News about being saved.)
\bttq What is the reason, do you think, that those people will be as angry and frustrated as the people in this parable?
\tqe They will see some of their ancestors and other Jews there in the kingdom and will feel they, too, should be there because they are also Jews. But Jesus does not choose people on that basis, so they are left outside the kingdom (and the blessings people will receive there).

\bttq What did Jesus say were the reasons that he spoke so sadly about Jerusalem?

\tqe Stoning refers to throwing stones, big or small, at a person for the purpose of killing him. Usually many people joined in the throwing.
\tqe (Note: Stoning was a way that God had said the Jews were to punish a person who blasphemed him. When the people of Jerusalem had stoned God's messengers, it was because the people or leaders had not accepted those prophets' messages as having come from God. They said that the messenger had made fun of God and had been disrespectful to him. The punishment for that was to die by stoning. See Lev. 24:13-16.)

\bttq To what time, do you think, was Jesus referring when the people of Jerusalem/the Jews would finally ask the Lord God to bless him? (35)
\an He referred to the time when Jews would believe that he was the Messiah whom God had sent.
\an -OR-
\an He referred to the time while he was still alive when he would arrive in Jerusalem for the last time (now called Palm Sunday), when the crowds of people at Jerusalem would welcome him. (See 19:38.)
\an -OR-
\an He referred to the time when he would come back to earth from heaven as God's representative.

\tqe They were silent./They did not answer him. (4)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the Pharisees and experts in the Law did not answer Jesus?

\an (Note: Many of the English language translations refer to the places of honor in this story with words such as "move up/higher/forward" or "move down/lower/backward" to reflect greater or lesser honor. That is culturally appropriate for English, but may not be the appropriate way to express greater or lesser honor in the language of the translation.

\bttq What do you think was the way that the people had been told earlier about the feast that God would have?
\tqe They had been invited long before by God's prophets. (Jesus had come at that time to tell those people that everything was ready.)

\bttq What did those people who had been invited earlier then say to the servant/slave?
\tqe Everyone had some kind of excuse [for not coming]. (18)
\bttq Tell me some of their excuses.
\tqe One person said that he had bought a field/garden/farm and had to go to see it. (18)
\tqe Another [person] said that he had bought five yoke/pair of oxen and was going to try them out/see if they did good work/see how well they plowed together. (19)

\tqe He told the servant/slave to go quickly to the city's streets and alleys
\tqe and bring the poor, or crippled, or blind, or lame [people whom he found there] to his feast. (21)
\bttq Do you think that the servant/slave went, did that and returned, or do you think that he had done it already, before the house owner told him to do it?
\tqe A servant/slave probably would not have done it before his lord/master told him to do so. He probably did go quickly and bring back those people he had found.
\an (Note: It may be that the brief wording here indicates just how quickly the servant went and did what his master had told him to do. If the translation seems to imply wrongly that he had already done this, suggest ways to avoid that wrong implication. One way may be to say very briefly at the end of verse 21 or at the beginning of verse 22, "The servant went quickly, did that and returned." A different way might be to say in verse 22, "The servant some time later said, ‘....'.")
\bttq What did that servant/slave report to his lord/master?
\tqe He reported that what the master had commanded/ordered [him to do] had been done,
\tqe and still there was room/space [for more people]. (22)
\bttq What did the lord/master of the house then tell his servant/slave to do?
\tqe The servant/slave was to go to the roads and paths [outside the city] and strongly urge those people to come in [to the house and the feast which was ready there]. (23)
\bttq How many more people was the servant/slave to bring?
\tqe He should bring enough people to fill the master's house. (23)

\rf Luke 14:25-35 A person who wants to be Jesus' disciple must be ready to let go of everything else he has and expect to be treated the same as Jesus was.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 14.25-35
\bttq What did Jesus say would prevent a person from becoming his disciple?
\tqe If that person did not hate his family members and even his own life, he could not be Jesus' disciple. (26)  (A disciple must be ready to let go of anything else that might prevent him from following Jesus completely.)
\bttq What do you think is the way that a person getting ready to build something is like someone getting ready to be Jesus' disciple?
\tqe When a person wants to build something, he must first evaluate the cost.
\tqe If he tries to be a disciple, but does not first evaluate everything, he may fail and other people may make fun of him. (28-30)
\bttq How is the way that a king prepares to fight a battle like someone getting ready to be Jesus' disciple?
\tqe When a king prepares to fight in a battle, he first evaluates whether or not he has a large enough army to defeat the enemy (31). If he does not, he [submits to the other leader and] seeks to settle the conflict peacefully.
\tqe If a person tries to be a disciple by his own resources, and does not first realize that he never will be able to do so on his own, he is sure to fail.  He must first be willing to give up his claim on all the things he has/owns [and submit to God]. (33)
\bttq What do you think is the way that salt which loses its flavor could be like a disciple of Jesus?
\tqe If a person tries to be a disciple, it is a very good thing, but if he does not first evaluate everything that might be required of him (26, 27, 28, 33), his life will be as useless/worthless as salt which has lost its flavor (34-35).

\an (Note: If all the same people have checked Luke's gospel from 9:21 to this point, you may skip the questions which are marked with an asterisk [*]. Otherwise, please ask all of them.)
\bttq When a person is serious about following Jesus, how must he regard/think about his family?
\tqe Jesus said that he must hate his family, (that is, he must love Jesus more than he loves his family). (26)  (See 9:24.)
\bttq God tells us in other verses in the Bible to love and obey our parents and to love our wives and children. What do you think that Jesus meant here when he said that a disciple must hate the people in his family?
\tqe Jesus did not mean that we should literally hate our family. He was comparing a person's love for his family with a true disciple's love for him/God. Compared to how great a disciple is to love Jesus, his love for his family is like hate.
\an (Note: Jesus again was speaking extremely strong words/speaking in exaggerations to shock the people into paying close attention to what he meant. This was a way of teaching which Jewish teachers used then, and it was not meant for people to obey literally.)
\bttq How must that person regard/think about his own life and the things he hopes will happen to him?
\tqe He must hate that, too, [compared to how much he is to love Jesus] (26). (See 9:23.)
\bttq *What do you think it means to hate oneself?
\tqe It means that a person does not think only about staying alive at all costs. He also does not think only about gathering more of the things which make him happy. (Jesus wanted people to think about God and be totally committed to him first.)
\bttq *What do you think it meant at the time Jesus lived when a person carried his cross? (27)
\tqe It meant that person was on his way to die (by being nailed on crossed timbers until he could not breath anymore).
\tqe Key Term Check: See "cross, crucify" in KBT.
\bttq *What do you think it means for people today to carry/bear one's cross and follow Jesus? (27)
\tqe It means that a person must be willing to suffer whatever happens to him because he is one who follows Jesus. He must be willing to die, even die on a cross, as criminals used to die, in order to remain faithful to God. That person's focus must be on Jesus, not himself.

\tqe He will send a group quickly to represent him to the other king and ask what they must do to have peace. (32)

\bttq What happens to that kind of salt?
\tqe It is thrown out [on the ground as being useless]. (35)
\bttq When Jesus finished telling these three comparisons about a person being his disciple, he said that the people with ears should listen. Every person has ears. What do you think he meant? (35)

\tqe There also were Pharisees and teachers of the Law there. (2)
\bttq What was the Pharisees' concern?
\tqe They did not like it that Jesus welcomed the "sinners" and ate with them. (2)

\rf Luke 15:11-32 Jesus told a parable about a son who came back to his father.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 15.11-32
\bttq What people are in this parable which Jesus told?
\tqe There is a father and his two sons (11),
\tqe the citizen/national of a far away country (15),
\tqe and the father's servants/slaves (22, 26).
\bttq How is the parable about the father and his two sons similar to the stories of the lost sheep (see 15:6-7) and the lost coin (see 15:9-10)?
\tqe The father said that his younger son had been lost and now was found. (24b, 32c)
\tqe He also told others to celebrate with him about this. (23b, 24c, 32a)
\tqe He was rejoicing more over one sinning son who repented than over the faithful son who had stayed with him and thought that he always acted rightly (29) and did not need to repent. (7)
\bttq How is the father in the story a picture of God?
\tqe God is ready to forgive any sinner who truly repents and comes back to him. (17-24)
\tqe God and those who belong to him are happy when each sinner does repent and return to God. (23b, 24c, 32)
\tqe God wants all those people who feel they are better children of God's than some other people who come back to God later on (29) to recognize the true reason for rejoicing (32). The faithfulness of that long-term, continuous service to God will be adequately rewarded later (31), but that should not stop them from rejoicing every time a lost "brother" or "sister" returns to the family of God.
\bttq A variety of people were listening to Jesus tell these stories, the Pharisees, the teachers of the Law, the tax collectors and the "sinners" (15:1-2). In what ways, do you think, was Jesus talking about them in this parable?
\tqe The older son thought of his younger brother in the same way that the Pharisees and teachers of the Law thought of those people whom they referred to as "sinners". (29-30)
\tqe The younger son had done things which did not please his father, but he had finally repented and come back to ask his father to forgive him. He wanted to please his father now, just as the tax collectors and "sinners" were doing.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 15.11-16
\bttq What did the younger son want from his father?
\tqe He wanted his share of the father's possessions, that part which would be his when the father died. (12)
\bttq What did the father decide to do about that?
\tqe He did divide his property/possessions between the [two sons]. (12)
\bttq In what way, do you think, was it divided between the two sons?
\tqe (The translation should not say or imply that it was divided equally. The Law of Moses [Deut. 21:17] had said that the oldest son would get an extra portion, or double what any other individual son might receive.)
\bttq What did the younger son do with his part?
\tqe He took it and went to a distant country/region and there he wasted his money in wild/ extravagant/careless ways. (13)
\bttq What happened after his money was all spent/finished?
\tqe A severe/serious/great famine occurred all across that country/region
\tqe and he began to not have any [food]. (14)
\bttq How did he find enough things to eat?
\tqe He got himself attached to/joined up with a citizen/national of that country/region who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. (15)
\an (Note: The Greek word does not indicate whether this son now received any pay, but only that he was closely associated with a landowner there. If he was paid, it was a minimal amount, and not enough to buy an adequate amount of food.)
\bttq Do you think that this was good work or bad work for this boy/son?
\tqe It was bad work for a Jew to work for or live with a non-Jew. It was even worse to work with pigs, which were regarded as ritually unclean and unfit to be eaten. (See Lev. 11:7-8 and 24-26.)
\bttq How bad was his hunger?
\tqe Very bad. He was even willing to eat the pigs' food, but no one even gave him [that much to eat]. (16)
\tqref LUK 15.17-20
\bttq What finally happened to this son when he was starving and the pigs may have been eating more than he was?
\tqe He came to his senses./His thinking became clear again. (17)
\bttq What did he realize when he began to think clearly about his situation?
\tqe His father's hired workers had more than enough food to eat, but he was starving to death. (17)
\bttq Did he think that, if he stayed where he was, he really would die?
\tqe Yes, he did.
\an (Note: Luke's use of the Key Term "destroy, perish" shows us how serious the famine was. The word used here is the same one Luke used in 8:24.)
\bttq What did he decide to do?
\tqe He decided to start out for home, (18)
\tqe admit to his father that he had sinned against [God in] heaven and against [his father] (18),
\tqe and ask his father to make him one of his hired workers, and not think of/call him his son (19).
\tqref LUK 15.20-24
\bttq What did his father do when he saw his younger son coming?
\tqe His father saw him while he was still a long distance away, (20b)
\tqe [his heart] was moved with pity/felt compassion [for him], (20b)
\tqe and running [to his son], he hugged him around the neck and kissed him. (20b)
\an (Note: The words used for the action of kissing as part of the Jewish cultural way for the father to greet his son here should be the same as was used at 7:45. Here, however, much more emotion can be included, as appropriate.)
\bttq What did the son say to his father?
\tqe He said, "Father, I have sinned against [God in] heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son." (21)
\an (Note: These words are exactly the same words and word order as in verse 18-19a. The translation should also have exactly the same wording in both places for these sentences. What the son said in verse 19b does not seem to have been said again to the father before he interrupted his son. Although the words of 19b are repeated in some Greek manuscripts, the most reliable ones do not have that sentence included here. If the translator wishes to have it in a footnote, then the wording should be exactly the same as in 19b.)
\bttq How do you know that the father did not do like his younger son had said?
\tqe The father wanted to dress his son in special clothes and jewelry (22)
\tqe and celebrate his return with special food for a feast (23).
\tqe He called the young man his son when he talked to his servants/slaves. (22-24)
\bttq What special clothes did the father tell the servants/slaves to dress his son in?
\tqe The best robe, a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. (22)
\an (Note: See TN for a description of what was culturally implied in the father's actions [20b] and words [22-23].)
\bttq What special food did the father tell the servants/slaves to get ready to eat?
\tqe The calf they had fattened. (23)
\bttq What did the father say was the reason that he wanted to feast and celebrate?
\tqe He said that this son of his had been [the same as] dead and [now] was alive again. (24)
\tqe The son had been [the same as] lost and [now] was found. (24)
\tqref LUK 15.25-32
\bttq Why did the older son ask a servant about what was going on in the house?
\tqe He had been in the field. (25)
\tqe When he came near the house he heard music and dancing. (25)
\bttq What did that servant tell him?
\tqe He told him that his [younger] brother had come [back] (27)
\tqe and his father had [ordered servants to] kill the fattened calf [and roast/cook it]. (27)
\bttq How did the older brother feel about that?
\tqe He became angry and did not want/he refused to enter [the house]. (28a)
\bttq What did the father do about his older son?
\tqe He came out[side] and kept on urging/earnestly asked for/strongly requested him [to go into the house and join in the celebrating]. (28b)
\bttq What did the older brother tell his father were the reasons that he was angry?
\tqe He had worked like a slave for his father for so many years and had never disobeyed his orders, but the father had never given him [even] a young goat in order that he might have a party with his friends. (29)
\tqe But for his brother who had used up [the money from] their father's property with prostitutes, and [just now] come home, the father had [servants] kill the fattened calf! (30)
\an (Note: The older son's choice of words shows that he felt as if his father had slighted him, that the father was rewarding the younger son's foolishness and disobedience and not rewarding the older son's hard work and obedience. If the translation can convey that feeling of anger and disappointment, it would reflect Luke's text well.)
\bttq What did the father say to show that he was not treating his older son badly?
\tqe He said that the older son had always been with him and everything the father owned now belonged to the older son. (They had been together enjoying life and those possessions all along and still had them!) (31)
\bttq What did the father say to show that he was not celebrating the younger son's past foolish actions?
\tqe He said that he had to celebrate because the younger brother had returned from [foolish actions which were like] being dead or lost. Now he was alive again and found. (32)

\tqe The servant manager had thought shrewdly about his situation and had prepared for his future life. This was typical of people who deal with each other in worldly things. They do that better than the people who focus on spiritual things do. (8)
\bttq If a person cannot be trusted with the things God has given him on this earth, how will that affect spiritual things which God would like to give him?

\bttq According to Jesus' explanation of the Law, who will also be guilty of committing adultery?
\tqe It is the one who divorces his wife and marries another,
\tqe and it is the one who marries a woman whose husband has divorced her. (18)
\an (Note: God's view of marriage, divorce, and adultery can be found in Gen. 2:24, Exod. 20:14, and Mal. 2:14-16. Jesus' explained what that meant in the kingdom of God in Matt. 19:3-9, and Mark 10:9, as well as here.)

\rf Luke 16:19-31 Jesus told a parable about a rich man and a beggar.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 16.19-31
\bttq This complete chapter has focused on wealth and one's relationship to God. How do you see this parable doing that?
\tqe This parable emphasizes obeying God's word as they know it and the importance of having the right attitude toward money and possessions. If people refuse to listen to and obey God's message which was in the Old Testament, then they will refuse the message about the kingdom of God which Jesus brought, even after seeing the miracles he did or seeing him after he rose from the dead.

\bttq How did Jesus describe the rich man's way of life?
\tqe He wore [expensive clothes like] purple robes and fine linen (19)
\tqe and lived in luxury/wonderfully every day. (19)
\bttq How did Jesus describe Lazarus's way of life?
\tqe He was a beggar [whose body] was covered with sores. (20)
\tqe He wanted very much to be able to eat what fell off/was thrown away from the rich man's table. (21)
\tqe [He was so sick and weak that] even the dogs came and licked his sores. (21)
\bttq How did Lazarus get to the rich man's house?
\tqe [Someone, probably friends,] laid him at the gate[way]. (20)
\bttq What happened to the rich man and Lazarus when they died?
\tqe Lazarus was carried to Abraham's side [in heaven] by angels. (22)
\tqe The rich man was buried. (22)
\tqref LUK 16.23-26
\bttq Where was the spirit of the rich man after he had died?
\tqe It was in the place of the dead. (23)
\tqe Key Term Check: The description or name of the place used here should be the same as the one used at 10:15. See "Hades" in the "hell, Hades, abyss" entry in KBT.
\bttq What was the rich man's way of life there in Hades?
\tqe He was in great pain/torture/agony. (23, 24)
\tqe He was very hot and thirsty in the middle of flames. (24)
\tqe [He implied that there was no way to relieve his suffering without outside help.]
\bttq The rich man called Abraham his father in verse 24. Then Abraham called the rich man his son. What was the real relationship between the two?
\tqe Abraham was the ancestor of all the Jews, so the rich man was being respectful of the man who started his entire group of people. Abraham replied with the appropriate response [in the Jewish culture].
\an (Note: The translation may use whatever terms from the culture would show respect for such a forefather and from that forefather back to his descendant.)
\bttq How did he want Abraham to relieve some of his pain?
\tqe He asked Abraham to have mercy/pity on him and send Lazarus to dip a finger in water and place it on the rich man's tongue in order to cool him off [a little bit]. (24)
\bttq What two reasons did Abraham give for not doing as the rich man had asked?
\tqe 1) He said that the rich man should remember that when he was alive, he had received his good things, but Lazarus had received bad [things]. Now in this place Lazarus was comforted/ comfortable, and the rich man was in great pain/torture/agony. (25)
\tqe 2) He said that there was a great chasm/deep space/ravine which [God] had placed there so that persons on either side could not go over to the other side. (26)
\tqref LUK 16.27-31
\bttq Why did the rich man want Abraham to send Lazarus to his father's house/descendants?
\tqe He had five brothers whom Lazarus should warn [about changing/repenting] in order that they not also come to that place of great pain/torture/agony. (28)
\bttq What did Abraham say was God's way of warning them already?
\tqe They had [the writings of] Moses and the Prophets. They should listen to them [tell why they should repent]. (29)
\bttq Why did the rich man think that Lazarus would be able to convince them better than the Scriptures?
\tqe If someone [rose] from the dead, he thought that they would [definitely] listen. (30)
\bttq What did Abraham say about that?
\tqe He said that if [those brothers] would not listen to [the writings of] Moses and the Prophets, neither would they be convinced by someone who rose from the dead. (31)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 17.1-4
\bttq To drown is a terrible way to die. What do you think that means about how God looks at one person tempting another to sin? (2)
\tqe He must hate it because Jesus said that God would punish that person even worse than if he had drowned.
\bttq What did Jesus say his disciples should do about these things?
\tqe He said that they should watch out for/beware of [this problem] among themselves. (3a)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 17.1-3
\bttq What kinds of things did Jesus say are sure to happen?
\tqe Things that will cause people to sin. (1)
\bttq What did Jesus say about God punishing a person who tempts/causes another person to sin?
\tqe It would be better for that person to drown in the sea than to suffer the horrible things which God will do to punish him. (2)
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he spoke of "these little ones"?
\tqe He was referring to children.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe … to those people who are new/young believers in Jesus.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe … to any believers who need God's help and protection.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe … to persons having low status, such as the poor people in the culture.
\tqref LUK 17.3-4
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he spoke about "your brother"?
\tqe He was referring to any close companion or fellow believer, and not directly to one's sibling. For the disciples, it would have especially meant any of the other disciples. (3b)
\bttq What are we to do if our companion sins?
\tqe We are to strongly warn/rebuke him. (3b)
\bttq What are we to do if that rebuke causes him to realize his sin and he repents?
\tqe If he repents, we are to forgive him. (3b)
\bttq What if he sins many times against us in one day, then repents each time?
\tqe If he repents, we are to forgive him every time. (4)
\bttq How many times did Jesus want the disciples to forgive others?
\tqe He said that the number "seven" in his example as representing as many times as that person repents.
\an (Note: The number "seven" in the language of the Jews, Hebrew, sounded like the word "vow, oath". This made the number have a strong sense of being fulfilled, of being complete. Thus, "seven" here stands for all the times that this situation might happen. In English, that sense is present when a person says something happened "a dozen times" or "a hundred times". The number's absolute value as "12" or "100" is not in focus so much as that a set of a large number of occurrences of that action has taken place.)

\rf Luke 17:5-6 The apostles asked Jesus to increase their faith.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 17.5-6
\bttq  How much faith, or what kind of faith, did Jesus say the apostles needed to do great things for God?
\tqe They only needed to have a tiny amount of faith, like a mustard seed is tiny, for God to work through them.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Their faith only needed to be active, to grow and develop, like the tiny mustard seed does, into something firm and able to believe that God could do anything through them [to advance his rule and reign in people's lives]. (6) (See 13:18-19 or Matt. 13:31-32.)
\dh Details
\bttq What did the apostles ask Jesus to do for them?
\tqe They asked him to add to/increase their faith [in him]. (5) (See "faith" in KBT in the "believe" entry.)
\bttq What example did Jesus use to show what a small amount of faith could eventually do?
\tqe It could cause a (mulberry) tree to come out [of the ground] by its roots and be [re-]planted in the sea. (6)

\bttq Who do you think was the apostles' master whom they were to serve?
\tqe Jesus/God.
\bttq Who do you think is the master whom Christian people today are to serve?
\tqe God.
\bttq Should a person who serves God expect great honor, thanks, or rewards for obeying him? Why?
\tqe No. He is only doing his duty/what he should do. He should be humble about it. (10)
\dh Details
\bttq When a servant/slave comes back from working in a field all day, what does he not expect his master to say to him?
\tqe "Come sit down/relax [and eat]." (7)
\bttq What does he expect his master to say?
\tqe "Prepare something for me to eat, (8)
\tqe and [then] having dressed [appropriately], serve me while I eat and drink. (8)
\tqe After that, you may eat and drink." (8)
\bttq Should that servant/slave expect the master to thank him because he did what he was commanded to do? Why?
\tqe No. He only did what he was told to do. (9)
\an (Note: Luke wrote Jesus' question as beginning with a negative. That made the question clearly imply that an answer of "No" was expected.)

\rf Luke 17:11-19 Jesus healed ten men who had leprosy, but only one thanked him.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 17.11-19
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the one man returned to Jesus?
\tqe He recognized that God['s power] was at work in and through Jesus. (15)
\bttq Based on what happened in this story, what does Jesus seem to expect from any person who asks him to help them? (17)
\tqe That person is not merely to ask for help or believe the word of God and enjoy the blessings, but also to be thankful.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 17.11-14
\bttq In which part of Israel was Jesus traveling at this time?
\tqe He was on his way to Jerusalem, traveling along the border between Samaria [province] and Galilee [province]. (11)
\bttq Who met up with Jesus as he entered a village there?
\tqe Ten men who had leprosy/a bad skin disease. (12)
\an (Note: See comments at 5:12-16.)
\bttq What do you think was the reason those men asked Jesus to have mercy/pity on them? (12-13)
\tqe They wanted Jesus to heal them.
\bttq Many sick people had come right in front of Jesus in order to be healed by him. What do you think was the reason these men called out to him from a distance?
\tqe God had told Moses not to permit people with leprosy/bad skin diseases to come close to others without letting the others know a person with leprosy was there. (See Lev. 13:9-17, 45-46 and Num. 5:1-5.)
\an (Note: If these Scripture-related cultural items are not known by the assistants, consider making a footnote or glossary item.)
\bttq God had told Moses that a person who had been healed of leprosy/bad skin disease should show his skin to a priest (see Lev. 13:9, 16-17, and 14:1-9). What happened to those ten men when they obeyed Jesus and started to go to a priest while they were still sick?
\tqe As they went, they were healed [and] made ritually clean again. (14)
\an (Note: See the note at 7:22 about the same Greek verb as Luke used here.)
\tqref LUK 17.15-19
\bttq What did the men do when they saw that they were healed?
\tqe Only one of them returned, praising God in a loud voice (15).
\tqe He quickly lowered his body, putting [his knees and] his face to the ground [in front of] Jesus' feet, and thanked him (16). [The rest went to see a priest, we assume.]
\an (Note: The Greek text emphasizes that this man was not a Jew, but a Samaritan. If that element of surprise can be included in the translation, it would reflect Luke's writing better.)
\bttq How do we know Jesus was surprised and disappointed at all this?
\tqe He asked [rhetorical questions] about where the other nine men were who had also been healed/made ritually clean. (17).
\bttq Why did he become so surprised and disappointed?
\tqe Because they had not returned to give praise to God, but only the non-Jew [Samaritan] had. (18)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the cause of the Samaritan man being healed/being saved?
\tqe He had faith/believed that Jesus could heal/save him [by God's power when no other way was possible]. (19)
\an (Note: The Greek verb used in this sentence means both things in this case. It can also be translated as "rescued". Jesus had healed all ten men. He may have meant here that this one man also had his sins forgiven because he had recognized the power of God at work in Jesus. [See 7:50.])
\bttq Jesus told this man to get up and go. Where was he going when he stopped and came back to Jesus?
\tqe He had been on his way, also, to show himself to a priest. (14)

\rf Luke 17:20-37 Jesus spoke about the way in which God would establish his kingdom on earth.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 17.20-37
\bttq Jesus talked much about the Son of Man returning/coming again. To whom, do you think, was he referring? (22, 24, 26, 30)
\tqe He was referring to himself.
\an (Note: See comments at 5:24.)
\bttq Jesus clearly implied that there would be a difference between the kingdom of God coming and the Son of Man coming again/returning. What was different in the way he talked about those two things?
\tqe The kingdom of God would not come visibly (21),
\tqe but the return of the Son of Man, Jesus himself, would be very visible (24).
\bttq What will people be doing when the Son of Man returns?
\tqe They will be doing their normal/ordinary activities, such as eating, sleeping, and working. (27, 28, 30, 34, 35)
\bttq After hearing about the flood and the fire from heaven in earlier times, what do you think that Jesus wanted his disciples to understand about what would happen suddenly one ordinary day when most people were not expecting it? (33-35)
\tqe He will return and save some [people, those who believe in him], but leave [all] the others [to be punished].

\tqref LUK 17.20-25
\bttq What did the Pharisees ask Jesus about?
\tqe They wanted to know when the kingdom of God would come. (20)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that people would not recognize the kingdom of God when it came?
\tqe There would not be visible signs beforehand to signal the kingdom of God was about to come. (20)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It would not be visible because it was inside people['s hearts]. (21)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It would not be recognized because it was [already] among them [in the person and work of Jesus, but they had not yet realized it]. (21-22)
\bttq How were the disciples going to feel before long?
\tqe They would feel they wanted very much to see even one day of the Son of Man [in all his glory, or, ruling and reigning as king]. (22)
\an (Note: Time may be one of those things in the language of the translation which cannot "come". Ask about it if the translation text literally says the time "comes".)
\bttq Would they see that happen soon?
\an No. (22)
\bttq What should the disciples do when someone would tell them where they could go to see the Son of Man?
\tqe They should not hurry to follow such people. (23)
\bttq Why should they not believe such reports that the Son of Man was in one place or another?
\tqe Because his coming would be [as dramatic and public] as lightning flashing from one part of the sky to another. (24)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Because his coming would be [as dramatic and public] as lightning flashes in one part of the sky and lights up [all] the other parts, or lights up [everywhere] on the ground. (24)
\bttq What did Jesus say must first happen before the Son of Man would come in his glory?
\tqe He must suffer many things/in many ways/much.
\tqe The people alive at that time [who had seen his miracles and heard him teach] would reject him/his claim to be the Messiah. (25)
\tqref LUK 17.26-27
\bttq Jesus compared the way that the world would be like at the time he returns as the Son of Man with another time. To what other time did he compare it?
\tqe He compared it to the time [long, long before] when Noah lived. (26) (See Gen. 6 and 7.)
\bttq What were people doing in that time when Noah lived?
\tqe People [did their normal activities, such as, they] were eating and drinking, (27a)
\tqe and getting married. (27a)
\an (Note: If the culture of the translation has separate ways to refer to a man or a woman getting married, use both ways here. The Greek text does that, too. Only one term is used in the answer here because English just has one term, "get married", for both men and women.)
\bttq How long did people do those ordinary activities?
\tqe Right up to the day Noah [and his family] entered the ark/boat [he had built]. (27b)
\bttq What happened suddenly which changed what those people were doing?
\tqe [God sent] a flood which destroyed all [those people]. (27c)
\bttq What about Noah and his family?
\tqe They had already gone into the ark/boat [and were safe]. (27)
\tqref LUK 17.28-30
\bttq To what time did Jesus also compare the way that the world would be at the time he returns?
\bttq -OR-
\bttq To what time did Jesus also compare the way that the world was at the time of Noah?
\tqe He compared it to the time [long, long before] when Lot lived. (28) (See Gen. 18:17-19:29.)
\bttq What were people doing in that time when Lot lived?
\tqe People [did their normal activities, such as, they] were eating and drinking, (28)
\tqe buying and selling, (28)
\tqe planting [food in gardens] and building [houses/buildings]. (28)
\bttq How long did people do those ordinary activities?
\tqe [Right up to] the day Lot [and his family] left [the city of] Sodom. (29)
\bttq What happened suddenly which changed what those people were doing?
\tqe That day fire and sulfur/burning hot stones came/[God sent] down from the sky like rain and destroyed all [those people]. (29)
\bttq What about Lot and his family?
\tqe They had already left [the city of] Sodom [and were safe]. (29)

\bttq To which "day" was Jesus referring in verse 31?
\tqe He was referring to the day when the Son of Man would be revealed/seen by all. (30)
\bttq What will people be doing on that day when he returns?
\tqe People [will be doing their normal activities, such as, some] will be [resting] on their [house] roofs, others [will be working] in their fields. (31)
\an (Note: These activities of people resting and working are also in verses 34 and 35. See 5:19 and 12:3 for how Jewish roofs were described.)
\bttq What did Jesus say about people stopping what they are doing when he arrives and then getting ready for him?
\tqe He said that no one was to go where his belongings were [in order to save them from the disaster which was coming]. (31)
\bttq What example did Jesus give to show what would happen if someone did that?
\tqe He told them to remember [what happened to] Lot's wife. (32)
\an (Note: All the Jews who were listening to Jesus knew what had happened to Lot's wife. She had thought more about her possessions which she was leaving behind than about obeying God and him saving her. She died the same as all the other people who had not obeyed God. This may need to be in a footnote or glossary item. See Gen. 19:15, 17, and 26.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen to the person who wanted to save his own life/keep on living the way he was?
\tqe He said that person would lose [his life]. (33a)
\bttq *That sounds like a contradiction in the way that people understand life and death. What do you think that Jesus meant by that?
\tqe The person who does not do as Jesus just said in verse 31 will lose his chance to have the spiritual, eternal life Jesus promised elsewhere in the gospels.
\tqe He may also die physically just like Jesus implied in verse 32 that Lot's wife died.
\an (Note: If the language assistant has not been a worshipping Christian for some time, he will find this question is impossible to answer. He has no context to fit it into, and the words are a paradox. Do not be critical of anyone's answer to this question.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen when a person loses his life because of his following Jesus?
\tqe He will save it/keep on living [eternally]. (33b)
\bttq *This, too, sounds like a contradiction in terms. What do you think that Jesus meant by that?
\tqe He cannot be talking about a person's physical life, so he must be referring again to spiritual life. The person who does as Jesus just said in verse 31 will receive the spiritual, eternal life which he promised to give him.
\tqref LUK 17.34-37
\bttq Will it be night or day when the Son of Man returns?
\tqe Both. Some people will be sleeping at night [on one side of the world], others will be working in the daylight [on the other side of the earth]. [Which one it will be at any one place we do not know.] (34-35)
\bttq What will happen to people at that time?
\tqe Some will be taken along, some left behind, [even within families or among friends]. (34, 35)
\an (Note: Jesus had not said where he would be taking those people, but it would be somewhere safe. From what he said in 16:19-23, he implied they would be taken to heaven like the man Lazarus had been.)
\bttq What did the disciples want to know about this return of the Son of Man?
\tqe They asked Jesus where [his return would take place]. (30)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They asked Jesus where [the things he just talked about in verses 30-35 would take place]. (37)
\bttq In what way, do you think, did Jesus' words about vultures and dead bodies answer their question?
\tqe Just like [it is obvious to people even far away when] vultures gather and circle over a dead body, Jesus' return will be obvious [as he already said in 17:24].
\tqe -OR-
\tqe When the Jews/mankind was totally dead spiritually, he would return to punish those people. (37)

\tqe (The answer should cover the basic outline of the story, including the judge's attitudes toward people, the widow being persistent, and the judge's reasons to finally answer her repeated requests.)
\bttq What did Jesus want his disciples to learn from this parable?
\tqe They should always pray [to God] and not get tired of it/give up/be discouraged doing it. (1)
\bttq How can we compare the judge and God?
\tqe The judge did not care about God or people (4), but God cares about the ones he has chosen (7).
\tqe The judge kept putting off helping the widow, even though she was persistent (3, 4), but God will not do like that; he will help quickly [when he decides to act] (8).

\bttq In what way did Jesus describe the judge?
\tqe The judge did not respect/revere God [and God's standard of right and wrong]
\tqe and he was not concerned about what people might think about the way that he decided court cases.     -OR-
\tqe The judge did not respect/revere God [and God's standard of right and wrong]
\tqe and he did not care about the people involved in the cases he decided. (2, 4)
\an (Note: The same Greek word was used to describe a judge in 11:19 and 12:58. The translation here should describe the judge and his role in as much the same way as it was in those verses.)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he said that the disciples should always pray to God?
\tqe He meant that they should pray very often and regularly to God and depend on him for all their needs. He did not mean they must only pray and do nothing else.
\bttq In what way did Jesus describe the widow?
\tqe She was persistent/kept on coming to the judge to do what was right. (3)
\bttq What did the widow want from that judge?
\tqe She wanted him to listen to her problem (3),
\tqe decide that another person was taking advantage of her (3),
\tqe and correct it [in her favor] (3).
\bttq Why did the widow keep on coming to that judge?
\tqe Because he would not take the time to listen to, and settle, the woman's complaint. (4)
\bttq Why did he finally do what the woman had wanted for a long time?
\tqe Because she was bothering him/wearing him out with her repeated requests. (5)
\tqref LUK 18.6-8
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus said that his disciples were to pay attention to what the corrupt judge had said/thought?
\tqe The judge said that he would help the woman because of her being persistent (5). Jesus then made a comparison to God answering our prayers to him (7-8).
\bttq If the people God has chosen as his have a need and are serious to have him help them, what are they to do?
\tqe They are to pray day and night/very regularly each day for that need. (8)
\bttq Who do you think these people are whom God has chosen?
\tqe Key Term Check: They are the people who believe that God sent Jesus as the Messiah/Christ to earth to save them from their sins. God knows who will believe that and he will save them. He also knows who will not believe that and he will punish them. (See Deut. 7:6-8a, 9:4-6; Matt. 22:14; John 15:16; and Rom. 8:28-33.)
\bttq When Jesus returns to earth as the Son of Man, for what will he be looking/wanting to find?
\tqe He will be looking for/wanting to find if there is anyone who still believes/has faith that he is the savior. (8)

\tqe A person who sins and humbly pleads for God to remove his sin/to be merciful to him [and forgive him] is declared right/ acceptable by God.
\tqe Those who believe that they can depend of their own good actions [to make them right with God] and who think that they are better than all other people will not be declared right/acceptable by God. They will be humiliated/shamed/ embarrassed [by him] (14).
\bttq What kind of person is it whom God will greatly honor?
\tqe It is the person who humbles himself [before God and other people]. (14c)

\tqe He compared himself with God/ with the things God had commanded people to do. (13)
\bttq What did that man say were reasons that he thought that God should help him?
\tqe He asked God to have mercy on him [and] remove/forgive his sin. (13)
\an  (Note: The Greek verb Luke used here includes more than the one English language action of "have mercy". Both of the actions in the answer above should be included in the translation. [See L&N entries 40.9 and 88.75.])
\bttq What did that man do which shows us that he was humble?
\tqe He stood at a distance [apart from others] (13),
\tqe he would not even look up toward [God in] heaven (13),
\tqe but was beating on/thumping his chest [as a sign of his sorrow over sins] (13).
\tqe The words of his prayer show that he did not think of himself as worthy of anything good from God. (13)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the result of those two men's prayers?

\tqe They would be the people who would not [humbly] accept his authority over them, like young children [accept authority over them]. (17)

\tqe sell everything he had and distribute [that money] to the poor [people] (22),
\tqe and then follow Jesus (22). (A person must get rid of everything that makes him feel secure and safe which is based upon what he possesses.)
\bttq What people will have a hard time entering the kingdom of God?
\tqe People who have wealth. (24-25)
\bttq What did Jesus promise for those who leave their family and possessions for the sake of the kingdom of God?

\bttq *What kind of life do you think eternal life is? (18)
\bttq (Note: If all the same people have continued to check Luke's gospel from 10:25 right through to this point, you may skip this question. But, if the consultant, translator, or key assistants have changed, or if there has been a time break of a week or more, please ask the question again.)
\tqe Key Term Check: It is a life that is not affected by time limits, such as whether a person is still alive physically or not. It can begin now while we still are alive and will go on forever, even after our bodies die. Jesus in his dying and rising on our behalf made it possible for us to have that eternal life. God graciously and freely allows us to have that new life. It is a life of having a close relationship with God, obeying him as he rules over us. (See "life" in KBT.)
\bttq Why did Jesus question the man about calling him a good teacher?
\tqe Jesus said that the term was used only to refer to God. (19)
\bttq Tell me the commands from God which Jesus spoke to the man about. (20)
\tqe Do not commit adultery.
\tqe Do not murder.
\tqe Do not steal.
\tqe Do not lie when you testify in court.
\tqe Show honor to your father and mother.
\bttq What did the man say about those commands from God?
\tqe He said that he had done [what they said to do] since he had been a child. (21)
\an (Note: The Greek verb Luke used here is the same one he used in 11:28. Because the context in both places is the same, it would be best to translate it the same way in both verses.)
\bttq According to Jesus, what more did the man have to do?
\tqe He must sell everything he had (22)
\tqe and distribute [that money] to the poor [people who did not have the things they needed] (22),
\an and then follow Jesus (22).
\an (Note: The translator may want to have a footnote or glossary item which indicates that Jesus was showing the man that there was still one more command which he had not obeyed in his dealings with other people. In the list of ten commands which God had spoken to Moses, the last one spoke about coveting, that is, wrongly desiring to have things. That sin was preventing this man from receiving the eternal life which he wanted. His desire for things got in the way of his desire for God.)
\bttq If the man did do that, where would he have anything of great value any more?
\tqe Jesus said that he would have [spiritual] things of great value in heaven. (22)
\bttq Why did the man become very sad/grieved?
\tqe He was very/extremely rich [and loved the things he possessed]. (23)
\tqref LUK 18.24-25
\bttq What did Jesus say when he saw the man's sadness?
\tqe He said that it is [very] difficult for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God. (24)
\bttq To what did Jesus compare a rich person entering the kingdom of God?
\tqe He compared it to a camel going through/entering the eye of a needle. (25)
\bttq Which one of those two things did Jesus say would probably happen more easily?
\tqe It would [almost] be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle (than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God). (25)
\bttq We know that no animal can go through the small eye of a needle. What do you think that means for the rich person and entering the kingdom of God? (25)
\tqe It is also impossible for people who depend on their earthly riches instead of only trusting God.
\tqref LUK 18.26-30
\bttq After Jesus made that comparison, how did the people who were listening respond?
\tqe They asked who could [possibly] be saved [from God's punishment, if what Jesus had said was true]. (26)
\bttq What was Jesus' answer?
\tqe The things [which are] impossible for man are possible for God. (27) (God can do what people cannot do. God saves a person. The person cannot save himself by possessing many things.)
\bttq What did Peter say about the disciples and the things they had possessed?
\tqe He reminded Jesus that they had left [all] their own things/family to follow him. (28)
\bttq What reward will a person have for having left home and family for the sake of the kingdom of God?
\tqe He will receive many times the amount he left behind, both in this time [of physical life] and in eternal life. (29-30)

\tqe Everything that the prophets had written [in the Old Testament] about the Son of Man would be accomplished/take place. (31)
\bttq What things did Jesus specifically say would happen?
\tqe [Someone] would betray him to the Gentile/non-Jewish people. (32)
\tqe They would mock/make fun of him (32),
\tqe insult him (32),
\tqe spit on him (32),
\tqe and flogging/whipping him, they would kill him (33).
\bttq Tell me what the people in your village would think if someone spit on them or at them.
\tqe (The answer should show the translator or consultant whether the intent of those who would spit on Jesus was also understood correctly or not. In that time, spitting on someone, especially in that person's face, was an extreme insult. That is how it should be understood by the people who hear this read.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen after that?
\tqe On the third day he would rise again [to life]. (33)
\bttq What did the disciples think about all this?
\tqe They understood nothing about it, that is, they did not know what he was talking about. (34)

\bttq Why did the blind man ask others what was happening?
\tqe He heard a crowd going past [him]. (36)
\an (Note: This implied that something important was happening, or that someone important was passing by. An important person with a crowd of people following him might be generous to the blind man when all those other people were watching.)
\bttq Who do you think that crowd of people was? (36)
\tqe It was Jesus' 12 apostles and other disciples, at the least,
\tqe maybe even other people who were also going to Jerusalem [for the Passover festival].
\bttq What did people tell him was happening?

\tqe He cried out/screamed to Jesus even more [loudly] for Jesus to have mercy/pity on him. (39)
\bttq David had been a king of the Jews many hundreds of years earlier. What do you think was the reason that the blind man called Jesus the Son of David? (39)
\tqe The man had heard about Jesus being the Messiah whom God had promised to send, so now the man called him by a common Jewish title for the Messiah. (See Luke 1:27, 32, 69; 2:4-7, 11; 3:31; and 20:41-44).

\tqe Later they talked at Zacchaeus's house. (6-9)
\bttq How did Jesus' visit with Zacchaeus change Zacchaeus's way of living?
\tqe He gave half of his possessions to the poor [people] (8)
\tqe and, if he had cheated anyone of anything, he promised to pay back four times as much. (8)
\an (Note: Although the Greek words are translated "If …," and leave the point unclear in English, the Greek grammar shows that Zacchaeus was admitting that he had sometimes cheated people concerning their taxes. He said, in effect, "To those people whom I have cheated, I now offer four times the amount back.")
\bttq What did Jesus say was the real purpose of him stopping to talk to Zacchaeus and staying at his house?
\tqe [He], the Son of Man, had come [to this earth] to search out and save those [people like Zacchaeus] who knew they were [spiritually] lost/without hope. (10)

\bttq Many people saw Jesus and Zacchaeus talking and walking together. What did they all think?
\tqe They were muttering/grumbling [among themselves] that Jesus had entered the house to stay overnight with a [man they assumed to be a blatant] sinner. (7)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Zacchaeus spoke about giving away his money?
\tqe His work was with tax money and giving those taxes to the [enemy] Roman government. People thought, or knew, that Zacchaeus had gotten rich by keeping more of that tax money than was right.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He changed because being with Jesus made him sorry for his past wrong actions.
\bttq What did Jesus say about Zacchaeus's promises?

\bttq How might Jesus have wanted the listeners to understand his parable?
\tqe Jesus would be going away and would not return until God made him to be king over all the people. In the meantime, other Jews would oppose him being the king over them. They should only expect to receive punishment when he returns.
\tqe -OR-

\an (Note: If the translation uses a reference to "coin" or to the Greek name of that coin, "mina", a footnote or glossary entry would be helpful to explain the value of it. Each servant received money equal to the pay for 100 days of work.)
\bttq What did the important man's fellow citizens/countrymen think and do about him going off to be made a king?
\tqe They hated him (14)
\tqe and sent a group to represent them and say, "We do not want this man to be our king." (14)

\tqe The first man had gained ten more coins/minas (16).
\tqe The second man had gained five more coins/minas. (18)

\bttq Why did another of the servants hide the coin/mina/money given to him by the master?

\bttq What did the master/king say to this servant?
\tqe He said he would judge the servant by the same words the servant had just used to describe the master, that is, by being very tough on him for not at least investing/loaning it out and collecting interest for the master. (22-23)
\bttq [Read verses 22-23 again. Then ask this question:] How do those words of the important man in your language sound to you? Do the words make you think that he was happy or frustrated or sad or angry?
\tqe He was frustrated and angry.
\an (Note: The question form in Greek is rhetorical and shows these feelings. The translation should use its own appropriate grammar or choice of words to convey the same feelings.)
\tqref LUK 19.24-27
\bttq What did the master/king do about this servant who had done nothing with the money?
\tqe He told other [servants] who were standing nearby to take the man's coin/mina and give it to the one who had [gained] ten. (24)
\bttq What was the people's reply?
\tqe They sound like they thought that the master's/king's command was not fair because that servant already had many coins. (25)
\bttq What did the master/king (or, Jesus,) say that the people were to learn from the way that the king treated the servants in the parable?
\tqe For the person who has faithfully served [God], [God] will reward/give even more to him. (26a)
\tqe For the person who has not faithfully served [God] with [the little bit] which [God] gave him, [God] will even take that away. (26b)

\rf Luke 19:45-48 Jesus drove men who were selling things out of the temple grounds.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 19.45-48
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus was so angry at the businessmen at the temple?
\tqe Because those people were not thinking about God and praying to him, but only about doing business and getting a profit, maybe cheating people, just like a group of robbers would do.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe In the noise of doing business, they were hindering the other people who really had come there to pray, which was the purpose of the temple. (46)

\bttq Are you able to tell if Jesus entered Jerusalem or if he stayed outside of the city because he was sad?
\tqe (The assistants may answer either "Yes" or "No" because they are looking at the wording of the translation.)
\bttq What words give you that idea?
\tqe (If the assistants answered, "No," to the question above, the translator may need to add some words in verse 45 to make it clear that Jesus continued riding the donkey into the city. We know he did because we read in verse 45 that Jesus entered the temple grounds which were inside the city.)
\bttq What were some of the people in the temple grounds doing?
\tqe They were selling things. (45)
\bttq How do you know that Jesus did not like what he saw?
\tqe He began driving them out [of the temple grounds] (45),
\tqe  telling them what had been written [by the prophet Isaiah] about the purpose of God's house. (46a)
\bttq What had God said to the prophet about the temple?
\tqe He had said that his house was to be a place where people would pray [to him]. (46a)
\bttq How did Jesus describe what the buyers and sellers had done?
\tqe He said they had made the temple grounds like a hiding place for people who steal from and cheat others. (46b)
\tqref LUK 19.47-48
\bttq What did Jesus himself do in the temple grounds/area each day?
\tqe He taught [the people about the kingdom of God]. (47)
\bttq What did the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and leaders of the people want to do about Jesus?
\tqe They tried to find a way to kill him. (47)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that they were angry enough to want Jesus to die?
\tqe Because they felt that they were the important religious leaders.
\tqe They felt they were the ones who had authority to decide what could happen inside the temple grounds, not Jesus.
\tqe They felt they were the ones to teach the people about God, not Jesus.
\bttq Why did they not just kill Jesus immediately?
\tqe [They were afraid the crowd would turn against them] because all the people were listening closely to what he taught them. (48)

\rf Luke 20:1-8 The religious leaders asked Jesus about where his authority came from.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 20.1-8
\bttq What did the groups of leaders of the Jews want to know from Jesus?
\tqe They wanted to know who had given him authority to do the things he had been doing. (2)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus did not give those men an answer?
\tqe Since they did not believe that God had given authority to John to baptize, then they also would not believe that God had given him (Jesus) authority to do what he had been doing. Therefore, it would be useless to say that God had sent him. They would not believe him anyway. (4-8)

\tqref LUK 20.1-4
\bttq What was Jesus doing when the groups of leaders of the Jews came to talk to him?
\tqe He was in the temple area teaching the people [who believed in him] and preaching the Good News [to others] [that God's plan to send the Messiah to save people was happening right then]. (1)
\bttq What question did they ask him?
\tqe They asked him who had given him the authority to do what he was doing at the temple. (2)
\bttq How did Jesus answer them?
\tqe He asked them a question whether it was God who had given authority to John to baptize [people] or whether only other people had given that authority to John. (3-4)
\tqref LUK 20.5-8
\bttq Why did those groups of leaders of the Jews first talk about this among themselves before they answered Jesus?
\tqe They knew that if they said [God in] heaven had given authority to John [to baptize people], then Jesus would ask them, "Why did you not believe him/believe what he said?" (5)
\tqe However, if they said it was [not God, but some other] people, then all the people who believed that John was a prophet [sent by God] would kill those leaders with large stones. (6)
\bttq How did they answer Jesus?
\tqe They said, "We do not know [who gave authority to John]." (7)
\bttq How did Jesus then answer their question?
\tqe He said that, since they would not tell him [who had authorized John to baptize people], he would also not tell them who had authorized him to do what he was doing. (8)

\rf Luke 20:9-19 Jesus told a parable about a landowner who rented his vineyard to some tenants.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 20.9-19
\bttq Tell me the different groups of people who are in Jesus' parable.
\tqe There was a man who planted a vineyard/grape garden (9b),
\tqe some farmers who rented/leased the vineyard (9c),
\tqe some servants whom the owner sent to get his share of the fruit which had grown (10-12),
\tqe and the owner's son (13-15).
\bttq What were the farmers/tenants who were supposed to watch over the vineyard wanting to do?
\tqe They wanted to have all the fruit from the vineyard and even own the vineyard themselves. (10b-15a)
\bttq What do you think was the reason those who listened to Jesus' parable did not want such a terrible thing to ever happen to them? (16b)
\tqe They recognized that Jesus was using picture language to tell them their leaders had rejected the many servants, that is, prophets, whom God had sent to the Jews.
\tqe Jesus was also telling them with this picture language that God had sent Jesus, his much-loved son, also, but the leaders had rejected him and would kill him outside the city.
\tqe The picture language also showed them that God would punish the leaders for all they had done,
\tqe and he would give his people to others to care for, which those listeners understood to be non-Jews. The listeners did not like any of this.

\tqref LUK 20.9-12
\bttq Who were the people to whom Jesus told this parable?
\tqe These were the same Jewish leaders who asked him that last question,
\tqe namely, the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders (20:1),
\tqe but the other people to whom Jesus had been teaching or preaching were also there.
\bttq Why did the owner of the vineyard/grape garden rent it out to some farmers/tenants?
\tqe He was going away for a long time [and wanted them to take care of it for him]. (9)
\bttq Why did the owner send a servant/slave back to those farmers?
\tqe So that the farmers would give the servant/slave some of the fruit [which had grown] in the vineyard [to take back to the owner]. (10)
\an (Note: It is also all right if the translation says that the servants came to get some of the money from selling the fruit, instead of saying they came to get some of the actual fruit.)
\bttq When a person in your language group uses the garden/land area of another person, how does that one give a payment to the owner of the land?
\tqe (Answers may vary, but expect many answers to include the giving of some of the harvested crop to the owner of the land.)
\an (Note: This is to highlight the purpose of the owner in the parable sending his servant to that vineyard, if such a practice is not common in the language area of the translation.)
\bttq What did the farmers do when a servant came to them?
\tqe They beat one servant/slave and sent him back with nothing. (10)
\tqe They beat another, did shameful things/gave shame to him and sent him back with nothing. (11)
\tqe They wounded a third servant and threw him out [of the vineyard]. (12)
\tqref LUK 20.13-15
\bttq Why did the owner of the vineyard send his much-loved son to the farmers?
\tqe He thought that they would respect/honor his son. (13)
\bttq What did the farmers say when they saw the owner's son coming?
\tqe They decided they should kill him so that they could get the vineyard for themselves. (14)
\bttq What did those farmers do to the owner's son?
\tqe They threw him outside the vineyard and killed him. (15a)

\bttq What did the listeners to Jesus' parable think about that result?
\tqe They said that should never happen. (16b)
\tqref LUK 20.17-19
\bttq Someone had written picture language about builders and a building stone, and now Jesus reminded the people of those words. Where were those words written? (17)
\tqe Someone wrote them in God's Word/in the part of the Bible we call the Old Testament.
\an (Note: The original words can be found in Ps. 118:22.)
\bttq What did those words say about a building stone?
\tqe Builders rejected a stone for their building,
\tqe but that stone is now the most important one to hold up the house.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe but that stone is now the most important one to hold everything else in its proper place. (17b)
\bttq What did Jesus say in his own picture language about that stone?
\tqe Everyone who falls over that stone will be broken into pieces
\tqe and everyone on whom the stone falls will be crushed (to fine powder). (18)
\bttq Who do you think that Jesus wanted the people to think were represented by the various parts of this picture language?
\tqe They were to think that the builders were a picture of the leaders of the Jews, (17b)
\tqe the stone which they rejected was Jesus, (17b)
\tqe the people who fall over that stone are those who do not believe that God sent Jesus (18a)
\tqe and the people on whom the stone falls are those who are punished forever because they do not believe in Jesus (18b).
\bttq Did those who were listening to Jesus understand that he was talking about them in those word pictures?
\tqe Yes, they did understand.
\bttq How do you know that they understood what Jesus meant?
\tqe The teachers of the Law/scribes and the chief priests tried to find a way to arrest Jesus right then. (19a)
\bttq Why did they not do it right then?
\tqe They were afraid of the people [who were right there and believed that God had sent both John and Jesus]. (19b)

\bttq Some men told Jesus that they wanted to know about paying taxes to the enemy Roman government, but what did they really want?
\tqe They wanted to make Jesus say something against the Roman government so they could arrest him and put him under the authority and control of the Roman government. (20)
\bttq What did Jesus say about obeying the government's laws, such as paying taxes?
\tqe He said that people should do whatever the king/government says they all must do, such as pay their taxes,
\tqe (and they should also do whatever God says they all must do). (25)

\tqe They wanted to turn him over to the [Roman] governor's authority and control. (20b)
\bttq What did the spies tell Jesus that they knew about him?
\tqe They said that they knew he spoke and taught correctly
\tqe and that he was not influenced by who people were,
\tqe but that he truthfully taught the way that God [wanted people to live]. (21)
\bttq What did they want to know about taxes?
\tqe They wanted to know if it was proper [for a Jew] to pay taxes to [the Roman Emperor/king] Caesar. (22)

\bttq When they showed Jesus a [Roman] denarius/coin, what did he ask them about it?
\tqe He asked them whose picture/shape and words were on the coin. (24)
\bttq Whose were they?
\tqe [The Roman emperor/king] Caesar's. (25a)
\bttq Jesus said they should do whatever was a part of the government work, such as pay their taxes. What, then, were the people to do about the things God said they should do?
\tqe Jesus said they should do both things, those which the government said were necessary
\tqe and those which God had said were necessary. (25b)
\bttq How well did those men's plan work, their plan to catch Jesus saying something wrong in front of many people?
\tqe It did not work. The men were unable to catch him in what he said.
\tqe They were so amazed at his answer that they were silent/they had nothing more to say. (26)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 20.27-40
\bttq Tell me the little story about seven brothers which the Sadducees told to Jesus.
\tqe The first brother of seven married a woman, but died without children. (29)
\tqe The second [brother], then the third married her, but they also died childless. (30-31a)
\tqe The [rest of the] seven [brothers] were the same, [marrying her, but] leaving no children [when they each] died. (31b)
\tqe Lastly, the woman died. (32)
\tqe When people are raised by God to live again after dying, whose wife will she be, having been the wife of each of the seven? (33)
\an (Note: The translation should not imply that the woman caused the men to die. This is not a true story about real men. The Sadducees created the story to try to trick Jesus. Its focus is on the idea of rising again after dying.)
\bttq What did Jesus say about people and their rising after being dead?
\tqe He said that people [whom God] declared worthy would rise to live again after being dead (35, 37),
\tqe but they would not marry (35), because they cannot die again (36a),
\tqe like the angels are (36b).
\tqe [Those people] are children of God, because they have been raised [by God] to live again [with him] (36c-d).
\tqe Even Moses showed that the [people who are] dead will be raised [by God] to live again when he referred to [God when he spoke to Moses out of] the burning bush as the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob, [ancestors who no longer were living on the earth] (37).
\bttq The Sadducees told Jesus that they wanted to know about people being married after they rose from being dead, but what do you think they really wanted?
\tqe Because they did not believe that people would rise again after being dead (27), they wanted to make Jesus look foolish as he tried to make an answer for something which they thought would never happen.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 20.27-33
\bttq What did Luke tell us about the group called the Sadducees?
\tqe He said that they did not believe that people would rise after being dead. (27)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Sadducees were a group, like a political party. They were rich, important Jewish families. Most of the members were priests who regarded the Laws of Moses as the most important part of God's Word. They did not believe that angels or Satan were real. See "Sadducee" in KBT in the "Pharisee, Sadducee" entry.
\bttq What did the Sadducees say was the rule about marriage which Moses had written down and taught to the Jews?
\tqe If a man's brother died, leaving his widow, but no children, that man should marry the [dead brother's] widow and have some children for his brother. (28)

\bttq Not every person whom we know who has believed in Jesus as his or her savior is still alive today. Some are dead. What do you think is the way, then, that they are all alive to God? (38)
\tqe We think about the bodies of those people and say they are dead,
\tqe but God looks at their spirit and says they all live on.

\bttq Who praised Jesus for his good answer?
\tqe Some of the teachers of the Law/scribes. (39)
\bttq Why did they praise Jesus?
\tqe The Sadducees did not dare ask Jesus any more questions [because he had shown their ideas to be wrong]. (40)
\an (Note: We assume that these teachers of the Law were not part of the Sadducees, but were part of the Pharisees, who did believe that God raised people to be alive again after dying. They also believed in angels. They often disagreed with the Sadducees about these things. [See Acts 23:6-9].)

\tqe David had called him his Lord. (42, 44)
\bttq Who were the two Lords whom David wrote about in the Psalm which Jesus quoted? (42)
\tqe The one who spoke was Yahweh, the supreme, eternal God of the Jews.
\tqe The one whom David called "my Lord" was the Messiah, the Christ, whom God had promised to send to save God's people.
\an (Note: Although the two persons are both called by the same name in the Greek and in the English bibles, in the original Hebrew writing, the words are clearly different from each other and do not confuse readers or listeners.)
\bttq What do you think is the answer to Jesus' last question about the Christ being both a descendant of King David and his Lord at the same time? (44)
\tqe The Christ [Jesus] was physically a human descendant in the family line of King David.
\tqe He also was a far greater person than King David because he was God's own son, who had been sent to this earth from heaven.

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 21.29-33
\bttq How would the people know that what Jesus was teaching them really would happen?
\tqe Just like new sprouts on a fig tree help people to know that summer is near, even so, when people see certain things happen [in nature], they should realize that other things which Jesus also predicted will naturally follow soon after that. (30-31)
\tqe When Jesus said something will happen, it will happen, even if the sky and the earth and the things we see there cease to exist. (33)
\dh Details
\bttq What do people know when they see sprouts appear on a fig tree?
\tqe They know that the time for summer is near. (30)

\tqe They would happen before the people who were living then at Jesus' time would die. (32)
\an (Note: Although some people interpret the words "this generation" in several other ways, when one looks at the other places where Luke used these words, they clearly refer to the people living in Jesus' time. See Luke 7:31; 11:29, 30, 31, 32, 50, 51; and Acts 2:40.)

\bttq Who first wrote the words that Mark put down here?
\tqe Isaiah, the prophet [of long ago], wrote the words that Mark quoted here. (2)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "prophet" in KBT.
\bttq When the prophet Isaiah wrote this quotation, who do you think it was who had said, "I will send my messenger ahead of you?"
\tqe God said that. (2)

\bttq To whom was God talking when he said those words which Isaiah wrote down?
\tqe God was speaking to his son, Jesus. (2-3)
\an (Note: This is implied, but it may need to be stated clearly if people do not realize that.)

\tqe Key Term Checks: See "repent" and "forgive" in KBT.
\bttq Tell me what a "lord" is.
\tqe Key Term Check: The word "lord" refers to a person who has authority over another person. God has supernatural authority over people because he created everyone and everything in the world. Sometimes he is called "the LORD God". (See "Lord" in KBT in both the "Christ" entry and the "God" entry.)

\tqe He teaches more of the parts of the Bible to the people who believe the talk about Jesus.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He harangues the believers to behave better than they have been doing.)
\an (Note: Neither of these two actions is what the Bible refers to as preaching. When one of the above answers is given, if at all possible, the translator should use other words that are appropriate to the action found in the Greek NT text. He should not automatically use the church word for "preach." Please ask the next question below before making any word changes.)
\bttq What do you think that John actually did in those places when he "preached"? (4)
\tqe John spoke out with authority to tell some news. (News that God had sent the savior he had promised to send.) In this verse, he also was telling people what they should do because of that news. [Key term check: See "preach" in KBT in the "gospel" entry.]
\an (Note: In English translations, three different Greek words are all translated "preach". The Greek word used in this verse means to speak with authority.)
\bttq  What did he tell the people to do?
\tqe He told them to repent and be baptized. (4)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "baptize" in KBT.
\bttq What would happen if they did this?

\bttq What did John do to the people?
\tqe He baptized them.
\bttq How does a person "baptize" another?
\tqe [Keep the person's answer in mind.]
\bttq Is there any other way to baptize people?
\an (Note: The idea here is to try to find a term for "baptize" that has a meaning broad enough to cover the different ways of baptism used by the different Christian groups in the area.)
\bttq What did the people do before John baptized them?
\tqe They admitted [to others/to God] how they had sinned. (5)

\bttq What did John wear?
\tqe John wore rough clothing that was locally made. (6)
\bttq What was John's main food?
\tqe John ate mainly locusts and honey. (6)
\bttq Why do you think that he ate like that?
\tqe It was simple food he could find in the wilderness.
\an (Note: Mark may have told us about John's food and clothing  because it was similar to that of the Old Testament prophets, especially Elijah. [See 2 Kings 1:8.] )
\bttq What did John tell the people about someone whom they would see later on?
\tqe He told them that the one who came after him would be a much greater person than he. (7)
\bttq Why would John not want to do (or, hesitate to do) even very simple work for such a person, like untying his shoes?
\tqe John understood how great that person was.
\tqe He felt that he himself was not really good enough to be even a servant to him. (7)
\bttq What was the difference between the way John baptized, and the way the person who would come after him would baptize?
\tqe John baptized people who repented with water. The one who would come later would cause people who repented to come under the influence of the Holy Spirit. (8)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe John used water baptism to show their change of heart toward God; the one who came later would use the Holy Spirit. (8)

\bttq What do we learn about Jesus from what God said?
\tqe We learn that Jesus is God's son.
\tqe Also, God loves him and is pleased with him. (11)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek language has several words which are translated "love" in English. The word used here means that a person has a gracious, outgoing, active interest in the welfare of another person. Jesus used the same word to talk about loving God and loving one's neighbor as one loves himself (Mark 12:30-31. Some cultures have a special term for a father's love for his oldest son or his only child. (See "beloved" in KBT in the "love" entry.) ]

\tqe Key Term Check: See "sin" in KBT.
\bttq When people read this, what will they think was Mark's reason for mentioning the animals here?
\tqe Mark probably only wanted to show that it was out in a lonely place where there were no people, just animals.
\bttq Who came to Jesus there?
\tqe Angels came from God. (l3)  [Key Term Check: See "angel" in KBT.]

\bttq When they did that, what did Jesus realize about them?
\tqe He realized that they had faith (that is, they really believed) that he was able to heal the man. (5)  [Key Term Check: See "faith" in KBT in the "believe" entry.]
\bttq How do you think that he knew that?

\bttq What did Jesus say to the paralyzed man?
\tqe He said, "I forgive your sins." (5)
\bttq What does a person do when  they forgive another person?
\tqe Key Term Check: They stop thinking about that person as having done something wrong against them. There is no need for the person who did wrong to compensate them, either by receiving punishment or by giving good things in return. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\an (Note: If the translation has a term for God forgiving people that is different from the term ordinarily used for people forgiving others, check into the reason for this difference. Try switching the verbs for forgiveness and ask what makes each one unacceptable in the people's minds. The Greek text uses the same word in both cases. God expects us to forgive others the same as he has done for us [Mark 11:25; Matt. 6:14-15; 18:32-3; Luke 6:37].)

\tqe He could also see the expression on their faces as he talked.
\bttq Who was Jesus talking about when he mentioned the "Son of Man"? (10)
\tqe He was speaking of himself.
\tqe Key Term Check: "Son of Man" is a title that the prophet Daniel used in Dan. 7:13-14. Daniel was referring to a human figure who is, nevertheless, a heavenly being. God gave him authority to be the leader of God's people on earth. The teachers of the law knew that this title referred to the Messiah. Jesus applied this title to himself. (See "Son of Man" in KBT. ]
\bttq After he said that he forgave the paralyzed man's sins, Jesus indicated to the teachers of the law that they could learn from what he was about to do. What did he expect them to learn?
\tqe He told them that when he forgave the paralyzed man, they did not believe that he really had done that. Now he would heal the man. Then they could know that he was from God, and therefore able both to heal and to forgive sin. (9-10)
\bttq How did the people know that the man was healed?
\tqe They saw him get up and walk away, carrying his mat. (12)
\bttq What did the people think when they saw the man get up and walk away?
\tqe They were amazed and praised (glorified/gave glory to) God. (12)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek word translated here as "praised" is the Key Term "glory/ glorify". Each meaning of that Greek word tries to describe a characteristic of God that people do not have. In this verse it refers to the best praise, honor, and giving of thanks that anyone can give to God because of his perfect goodness to them. (See "glorify" in KBT in the "glory" entry. ]

\oh Overview
\tqref MRK 2.18-22
\bttq What was the most important thing that Jesus was trying to show people in these verses?
\tqe He was trying to show them that his teaching involved a whole new approach. If they tried to follow their traditions and just add some of his new teaching, it would not work. (19-22)
\dh Details
\tqref MRK 2.18-20
\bttq What was it that the disciples of John and the Pharisees did?
\tqe They  fasted, that is, they went without food for a period of time (to help them think aboutGod.) (18)
\tqe Key Term Check: When they fasted, they avoided eating food for certain periods of time according to the Jewish traditions and teaching of their religious leaders. The purpose was to focus their thoughts better on God.
\bttq Did the followers of Jesus do the same thing?
\tqe No. (implied in 18-19)
\bttq What did the people ask Jesus?
\tqe They asked him why his disciples did not fast when the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fasted regularly. (18)
\bttq How did Jesus answer them?
\tqe He answered them by using picture language (that is, he told a story with a hidden meaning). He said that during a wedding festival, friends of the honored man (that is, the bridegroom) would not fast. (19)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen one day?
\tqe He said that the honored man (bridegroom) would be taken away from them (killed). That is the time when his friends would fast. (19)
\bttq Who do you think that Jesus was talking about when he spoke of  the bridegroom, and his friends?
\tqe He was talking about himself and his disciples being together and later being separated.
\an (Note: Both the near and the distant context suggests this meaning.)
\bttq What answer did Jesus' picture language give them about why Jesus' followers did not fast?
\tqe Jesus showed them that his disciples were right to rejoice and not fast (a sign of sorrow) while he was with them.
\bttq Do you think Jesus would care if his disciples fasted if they decided to do that?
\tqe No.
\bttq How can we tell that?
\tqe He said in his picture talk that later, when people took him away from them, his disciples would have a real reason to fast.
\tqref MRK 2.21-22
\bttq What was one thing that Jesus said people do not do?
\tqe They do not mend an old garment with a piece of new cloth. (21)
\bttq Do people in your village ever mend an old garment with a piece of new cloth?
\an (Note: Check for possible mismatching contrast with local cultural practice here.)
\bttq What was the second thing that Jesus said people do not do?
\tqe They do not put new wine in an old goatskin [bag/bottle]. (22)
\an (Note: When people seal new wine in a leather container, it will ferment and swell up. An old leather bag is no longer pliable and will break. Both the wine and the bag are ruined.)
\bttq When Jesus spoke about cloth and about the wine and bottle, what was he teaching the people?
\tqe CLOTH-Jesus was teaching that his new teachings cannot be like a patch on the peoples' old system of beliefs. They needed to change their whole approach to God and their belief system.
\an WINE BOTTLE-Pouring some of his teaching into their old non-pliable system was not going to work. They needed to realize that his teaching was new and they needed to follow it all. (Note: Watch carefully for people understanding the meaning wrongly because they are living in a different time and place than Jesus and his listeners.)

\rf Mark 2:23-28 Jesus showed the Pharisees that he had authority over the Sabbath day.
\oh Overview

\tqe Because they were hungry. (implied from verse 25)
\bttq What did the Pharisees say was wrong about that?

\tqref MRK 2.25-26
\bttq Why did Jesus remind them about what their honored ancestor David had done?
\tqe That situation was similar to the disciples picking a bit of food on the rest day. In David's case, he had gone against the law concerning special bread that was kept in the temple. Only priests were allowed to eat that bread. When he and his men arrived at the temple hungry, he had asked the priest, and received from him, some of that special bread. He ate part of it. Then he also gave some to his men to eat(and God did not punish him.) (25-26)
\tqref MRK 2.27-28.
\bttq What do you think that Jesus was implying about what David and his men had done?
\tqe He was showing that it was all right for them to do that when they were hungry and the special bread was all they could get to eat.
\bttq What was Jesus teaching the Pharisees?
\tqe He was teaching them that the rest day was not meant to make people suffer, like going without food. The rest day is to help people. (27)
\bttq The Pharisees had asked why the followers of Jesus were doing work on the Sabbath day and therefore were breaking the laws. How did Jesus answer that question?
\tqe Jesus said that he, the Son of Man, is the boss over the Sabbath day, and therefore knows how to apply the Sabbath day laws. (28)

\oh Overview
\tqref MRK 3.1-6
\bttq Why did the Pharisees watch Jesus intently after he entered the synagogue?

\bttq Do you think that the man stood up?
\tqe Yes. (Jesus continued talking to the man, so we assume that the man had obeyed him.) (3)
\bttq What question did Jesus ask the people who were there?
\tqe He asked them if it was all right to do bad things or to do good things on the rest day. He also asked if it was all right to kill people or to save them from dying on the rest day. (4)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "save" in KBT.
\bttq How did they answer him?
\tqe They did not say anything. (4)
\bttq Why do you think that they did not say anything?
\tqe They knew that they could never say it was all right to do bad or to kill people. They did not want to say it was all right to do good on the Sabbath day, since it would then be all right for Jesus to heal the man that day. They must have thought it best not to say anything.
\tqref MRK 3.5-6
\bttq Why do you think that Jesus was so angry and upset as he looked at them?
\tqe It seems clear that they did not feel sorry for the man with the shriveled hand.
\tqe They did not want to learn more about God nor to change. (2-5)
\bttq What did Jesus say to the man?
\tqe He told him to stretch out his hand. (5)
\bttq Then what happened?
\tqe As the man stretched out his hand, [God] healed him. (5)
\bttq What did the Pharisees do then?

\an (Note: The Romans ruled over the Jews at that time.) (18)
\bttq What does Mark say here about Judas Iscariot?
\tqe Judas was the one who would later betray Jesus by turning him over to his enemies. (19)
\an (Note: Check that the way these verses are written does not imply that Judas had already betrayed Jesus. Mark wrote these verses after Judas betrayed Jesus, but that had not yet happened at this point in Jesus' life.)
\bttq What do you think it means to betray someone?

\tqe He was teaching that Satan would not drive the other evil spirits out of a person. (23-26)
\bttq How did Jesus show that his power did not come from Satan?

\bttq If the people who speak your language use picture language/parables, tell me one of those stories and then tell me its meaning.
\tqe Key Term Check: A parable shows its meaning indirectly by using picture language to make a comparison. The storyteller generally does not explain the parts of the comparison. The listeners themselves must think about the meaning that the storyteller has hidden in the different parts of his picture language. Jesus taught spiritual truths in this story form. (See "parable" in KBT.)
\bttq What is the difference between Beelzebub and Satan? (22-23)
\tqe They are not two different people. They are just two different names for the same spirit being.
\bttq Why would Satan not drive out evil spirits?
\tqe Groups like families, clans, and governments, do not fight with each other otherwise they would break up. Likewise, Satan would not oppose his own evil spirits and cast them out, or soon he would no longer have any evil spirits to follow him that he could rule over. (26)

\bttq Why did Jesus begin talking about people who speak against the Holy Spirit?
\tqe When those people saw Jesus use the power of the Holy Spirit, but said that Jesus was using the power of Satan, they were speaking (that is, blaspheming) against the Holy Spirit. (29-30)
\bttq What did Jesus say about the punishment for anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit?
\tqe He said that (God) will never forgive people that do like that. Their punishment will last forever. (29)

\tqe He wanted them to learn that all who do what God wants are like family members to him. (34-35)
\bttq Do you think that Jesus refused to go and talk to his own family?
\tqe Mark did not tell us about that, but only about what Jesus wanted to teach from that situation.
\an (Note: Jewish teachers used to start with something that was happening and then teach something else from it. When the crowd mentioned family, Jesus similarly started from that thought and taught about his close relationship to people who obey God. This was the important part that Mark wanted us to know.

\bttq What happened to the others, those who were not Jesus' followers?
\tqe They were like some of the Israelite people of Isaiah's time. Isaiah wrote of them that they saw and heard what God was doing, but they did not understand the meaning of it. They did not want to change, and were not seeking God's forgiveness.
\an (Note: In what Isaiah had written, it was the people's own choice that they did not respond. They were the ones thinking "lest at any time we should turn and be converted." Here in these verses some of the hearers were hostile, so Jesus used parables to help him  proclaim the message without causing them to reject it.)

\tqe He was talking of  the good news.
\bttq What do you think that Jesus was saying about this good news?

\bttq Why did he use only parables with them?
\tqe He used parables because he only taught people as much as they would understand/accept. (33) (Note: They could listen to his parables without being offended. Thinking about these or discussing them with others they could gradually learn more. With their view being so different from what Jesus knew about the kingdom of God and the Messiah his using parables helped to keep them from rejecting him completely and not listening anymore.)
\bttq To whom did he explain all of the parables?
\tqe He explained them to his followers. (They really wanted to know and follow his teaching.) (34)

\bttq What did some of Jesus' disciples do that the Pharisees saw and became upset?
\tqe His disciples ate food without first washing their hands in the proper ritual as their ancestors had said that all Jewish people should do to please God. (2-5)
\bttq What is it that really makes people unclean?
\tqe It is the evil things that they think and do, coming from their own evil nature/desires. (23)
\tqref MRK 7.1-5
\bttq What did some Pharisees and teachers of the law see some of the disciples doing?
\tqe They saw them eat without first washing their hands in a special way for ceremonial cleaning. (1-4)
\bttq What did the Pharisees want the disciples to do?
\tqe The Pharisees wanted them to clean their hands from a religious uncleanness as their ancestors used to do. (5)  [Key Term Check: unclean/defiled]
\bttq Why do you think that the Pharisees kept thinking that their custom of special washings was so important?
\tqe They believed that  people who did not follow this custom, were doing bad in God's sight. They thought that people had to follow certain rituals to stay clean in order to show that they wanted to obey God's laws.
\tqref MRK 7.6-8
\bttq What did the Pharisees do that caused Jesus to become angry?
\tqe They insisted that people must obey their Jewish customs that their ancestors had made,
\tqe but were not concerned about obeying what God had commanded. (6-8)
\bttq What might a person that speaks this language do that would cause other of his people to call him a hypocrite?
\tqe (Listen for any possible wrong understanding of what Jesus meant here.)
\tqe Key Term Check: hypocrite. Such a person pretends to believe or do what other people will approve of or praise him for. He does not do it because he really believes that what he does is right or good.
\bttq What commands/commandments do you think that the Lord expects people to obey?
\tqe Key Term Check: commandment. The answer should focus on actions like those God named in the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20:1-17; Deut. 5:1-21. It also may include other instructions God gave to his people, as well.]
\bttq Why did Jesus talk about Isaiah?
\tqe Isaiah had written (in the Old Testament) about Jewish people of that time who were just like these Pharisees. Those people acted like they cared for and worked for God, but they really were only concerned with themselves. (6-9)
\tqref MRK 7.9-13
\bttq Will people who read verse 9 think that Jesus was praising the Pharisees?
\tqe He was not praising them. He was angry at what they were doing.
\an (Note: Jesus was using a figure of speech called ‘irony'. That is, he was saying the very opposite of what he meant. When he said, "You have a great way of setting aside God's commandments...," he meant, "You have a very bad way of acting. You ignore God's commands and make up your own rules that do not agree with what God has said.")
\bttq Jesus gave an example to show how the Pharisees were teaching the people wrongly. They were not following God and his teaching like they pretended they were. What were they doing?
\tqe They said that they were teaching God's laws, while they were actually teaching their Jewish traditions. (9)
\bttq What was the difference between the command that Moses gave them from God and what the Pharisees were saying and doing?
\tqe  Moses had given them a firm command that people should respect and help their parents.
\tqe  The Pharisees were now telling people that if they ever dedicated things to God as an offering, they could not later change their minds and use those things to help their parents, even though their parents may have no other goods or money. (10-12)
\an -OR-
\tqe      The Pharisees were now saying that people could avoid giving to their needy parents by making an oath that set aside what they owned as being already dedicated for future offerings to God. (10-12)
\bttq Why was what the Pharisees were doing so bad?
\tqe They were using their own customs and traditions to avoid having to follow God's commandments. (13)
\tqref MRK 7.14-16
\bttq What did Jesus say to all the people?
\tqe He said that we can not be made unacceptable to God by what we eat (like wrong food or some uncleanness) coming into our bodies. Rather, it is the evil actions that start in our own inner thoughts that make us unacceptable to God. (l5-l6)
\tqref MRK 7.17-19
\bttq Did the other people there that day and the disciples understand easily what Jesus was teaching them?
\tqe No. (17)
\bttq According to Jesus' explanation to the disciples, what was he talking about when he mentioned, "the things which are outside of people which enter them"?
\tqe He was talking about food (and any physical or ritual uncleanness) which goes into people's bodies. (18-19)
\bttq  What do you think may have made it difficult for the disciples and the others who heard Jesus teach that day to understand that what people eat does not offend God..
\tqe The Jewish religious leaders emphasized a lot of food and touching restrictions .Jesus' teaching was quite different and they had difficulty understanding that he was actually saying that breaking the many of food and pollution restrictions was not what would offend God. They needed to make a decision as to whether they would follow Jesus or their tradition. He said that their slowness to understand was caused by their hardness of heart. (6:52; 8:14-21)
\tqref MRK 7.20-23
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he spoke of "the things that come out from a person"?
\tqe He was talking about the bad things we do because of bad desires that come from within us. (20-23)
\bttq Can you name three of the bad actions which Jesus said start in our own thoughts.

\tqe She wanted him to send an evil spirit out of her daughter. (25)

\tqref MRK 7.27-28
\bttq Does Jesus' reply sound as if he was agreeing to do what the woman had asked? (27)
\tqe No, he was not agreeing with her. [He implied that she was like a dog compared to the Jews.]
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he talked about children and bread and dogs?
\tqe Jesus was saying that he had come to help the "children", the Jews, and that they should be helped first before he helped the "dogs",( which is what Jews sometimes called non-Jews).
\an (Note: The meaning of what Jesus said here probably will not be easy for people to understood.
\an Points to check: Is it clear that Jesus was using a "proverb" with figurative meaning? If not, is it possible to include some clue to indicate that? Is the fact that the woman was not a Jew shown plainly enough (vss. 24 & 26)? It may be possible to put that in the section heading.)
\bttq How did the woman reply to Jesus?
\tqe She said that even the dogs under the table get some of the crumbs. (28)
\bttq What do you think she meant?
\tqe She meant that maybe there could be some small amount of help that Jesus could use for a non-Jew, such as her, too. (28)
\tqref MRK 7.29-30
\bttq Does Jesus' answer to the woman sound as if he was angry with her or pleased about her reply?
\tqe He was pleased with her.
\bttq How can you tell that Jesus was pleased with the woman's reply?
\tqe He told her that she could go [because he had answered her request and had sent the demon out of her daughter]. (29)
\bttq Why do you think that Jesus was pleased with the woman's reply?
\tqe It may have been because she persisted in asking for what she wanted.
\tqe  -OR-… because she clearly believed that he was able to do it.
\tqe  -OR-…just because it is in God's plan that his gracious blessings should reach to all people groups.
\an (Note: This question is a check for any obvious misunderstanding.)
\bttq What did the woman find out when she arrived home?
\tqe She found out that the demon/evil spirit had left her daughter and she had recovered. (30)

\bttq How do we know that the man was able to hear and speak?

\bttq Do you think that God wants people to cut off part of their body or gouge out an eye if it causes them to sin?
\tqe No. He does not want that. Jesus was teaching how very serious sin is so people would understand that and not sin. By not sinning, they would avoid God's serious punishment for disobeying him, that punishment being even worse than cutting off part of one's body. (48)

\bttq Why is it necessary for people to go through difficulties (like being "sprinkled with fire")?
\tqe In this way they will become more serious and more pure like God wants them to be.

\tqe They knew that if they said that God had sent John to preach and baptize, then Jesus would ask why they did not believe John the Baptist's message. If, however, they said that it was not God who sent John the Baptist, then the people would turn against them because the people believed that God had chosen John to be one of his prophets. (31-32)

\tqe He dug a pit so that he would have a place to put the grapes in order to tramp the juice out of them.
\bttq Why do you think that he built a tower?
\tqe He made a tower so that he could go there and watch for wild animals or birds that might eat or ruin the grapes.(The tower probably provided a place to stay and to store grain as well as a good placed above the vines from which to watch the field.)

\tqe They knew that God often used a vineyard to represent Israel in the Old Testament scriptures. They also knew that they were the ones whom God had put in charge of his people, but they and their ancestors had rejected the prophets whom God had sent, and treated them badly. Jesus was warning that as the owner of his vineyard  God would punish those leaders and get others to watch over his vineyard (his people).

\an (The translator could explain in a footnote that the Old Testament writers commonly referred to Israel as God's vineyard.)
\bttq Why were the Jewish leaders afraid of the crowd?
\tqe The Jewish leaders were afraid because they knew that the ordinary people believed that God was with Jesus.
\tqe They knew that the people might rebel against them if they tried to arrest and kill him. (12)

\tqe They said that there were seven brothers, and the first married and died without having any children. (20)

\bttq What did they want Jesus to decide from their story?
\tqe They wanted him to tell them whose wife she would be, when all seven of her husbands were alive again after the resurrection. (23)
\bttq Why do you think that the Sadducees asked that question?
\tqe It was a trick question. They thought that in order to answer it Jesus would have to choose to disagree with God's law that Moses wrote or else agree with them that his own teaching that people live after dying was wrong.
\tqref MRK 12.24-25
\bttq What was Jesus' attitude toward the Sadducees?

\bttq How did Jesus show that people will rise again from death?

\bttq What do you think Mark meant when he wrote about an "abomination of desolation"?
\tqe (The meaning in the Greek text is not very clear.

Because of this shocking thing, God will withdraw from that place leaving it desolate.)

In comparing this with Isaiah 24:21-23 and 34:4 and Rev. 6:13-14, it seems that this could be figurative language for great disruption in or complete loss of leadership when the Jews are scattered, or when Christ sets up his final reign, or both.)

\bttq What did the woman do?
\tqe She broke open the jar and poured the perfume on Jesus' head. (3)

\tqe He said that because his blood would spill out, God could make a covenant with people. (24)

\tqe Key Term Check: A covenant  is an agreement, an especially binding promise. If a person on one side of the covenant does not do as both have agreed, there usually is a strong punishment for him or he pays compensation to the other person. Similar agreements now are called contracts. When  God makes an agreement with people, however, he makes a firm promise of what he will do and says what they must do. [See "covenant" in KBT.]
\tqe
\tqe (Note: If the language has a special name to refer to these kinds of agreements, ask the assistant to tell you the kinds of situations in which the people make the agreements. Listen for any points where it would not be appropriate to state that God made that kind of an agreement. Then adjust the translation as necessary.)

If it sounds very similar to "Abba," only use the vernacular word.

\bttq What did the High Priest say to Jesus?
\tqe He said that Jesus should answer the accusations. (60)
\bttq  What surprised him?
\tqe He was surprised that Jesus did not defend himself. (60)
\bttq What will people who read/hear this think the reason was that Jesus did not answer the High Priest's questions?
\tqe The High Priest already knew Jesus had not done anything wrong,
\tqe and Jesus was ready to die for us, so there was no need  for him to say anything.
\an (Note: In some places, if someone accuses another person, but that person does not answer any questions, people assume that he is guilty. This question is a check for such possible misunderstanding of Jesus' not replying.)
\tqref MRK 14.61-62
\bttq What question did the High Priest then ask Jesus?
\tqe He asked Jesus whether he was the Christ, the Son of God, or not. (61b)

\tqe This refers to him being equal to or next in authority with God. (62)
\an (Note: In Jewish custom the right hand side of important people was the most honored position anyone could ever have. Therefore, this figure fits well and shows that Jesus now is there next to God, sharing in what God does.)

\tqe Jesus had openly claimed that he was the Son of God, and they all had heard him say it. (62)
\an (Note: By the Jewish law and by the scriptures no ordinary person could claim that he was equal to or greater than God. So, since they would not admit that he was God's son, they thought that they had enough evidence to condemn him to die.)
\bttq What did the court officials say that Jesus' punishment would be?
\tqe They said that he would have to die. (64)
\tqref MRK 14.65
\bttq What are some of the things people then did to Jesus?

\bttq What do you think is the meaning of the Christ in 1:17?
\tqe Key Term Check: "Christ" is the English rendering of the Greek word Christos, which means "God's anointed one." (See "Christ" in KBT.)

\tqe The angel told him that it would be a boy, and that Joseph should name him Jesus, (which meant "Savior"). He was to name him that because he would save his people from their sins. (21)
\bttq What does it mean to "save people from their sin"?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that Jesus/He saves people from remaining guilty in God's sight, and so from receiving the punishment they would otherwise receive because of their sin. (See "save" in KBT.)

\tqe An Old Testament prophet had said/written that. (22-23)
\bttq What do you know about prophets?

\bttq What does the name Emmanuel mean?
\tqe Emmanuel means "God is with us". (23)

(See "Jew" in KBT in the "Israel" entry.)
\tqref MAT 2.3-6
\bttq What caused Herod to be worried?
\tqe When Herod heard that the king of the Jews had been born, he was worried that this Jewish boy might cause the Jews to reject him, since he was a Roman king who was ruling over them. (3)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the people of Jerusalem were also disturbed?
\tqe They also were afraid because they knew that, if the Roman government leaders began thinking that the Jews were preparing to choose/have their own king, the Romans would send their soldiers to punish the Jews.
\an (Note: This is a check for wrong meaning.)
\bttq What is the reason that Herod called together the chief priests and scribes?
\tqe He called them together in order to ask them where that/this important leader, who was referred to as Messiah by the prophets in the Old Testament, was to be born. (4)
\bttq What do you know about the chief priests?
\tqe Key Term Check: The chief priests were the leaders among the priests at the temple in Jerusalem. They decided everything that had to do with the worship of God and with the use of the temple grounds. (See "chief priest" in KBT.)

\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 2.13-18
\bttq Where did Joseph take Jesus and Mary?
\tqe He took them to Egypt. (14)
\dh Details
\bttq What is the reason that Joseph took Jesus and Mary to Egypt?
\tqe He took them to Egypt because an angel had appeared to him in a dream and told him to do that, before Herod's soldiers/men could find and kill Jesus. (13-14)
\bttq In verses 14 and 15 Matthew wrote/it says that they went and stayed in Egypt, until Herod died, and that what they did fulfilled what a prophet had written in the Old Testament. That prophet had written, "I called my son out of Egypt." How do you think this event fulfilled that prophecy/writing/saying? (See also verses 19 and 20.)
\tqe This was the time that God's son went to Egypt, so that later he could be called out of Egypt, as Matthew wrote in verses 19-20.
\an (Note: The translation may need to mention that this action by Joseph was a fulfillment of the statement "I called my son out of Egypt.")
\bttq What did Herod do when he realized that the Magi had not come back to report where they found the child, as he had asked them to do?
\tqe He sent his men/soldiers to Bethlehem to kill all of the boys two years old and younger that lived anywhere near Bethlehem. (16)
\bttq How did killing the Bethlehem children like that fulfill what the prophet Jeremiah had said/written in a kind of poetry which is quoted here in verse l8?
\tqe Ramah refers to a place near Bethlehem.
\tqe Rachel refers to Isaac's wife who is/was viewed as the ancestral mother of the nation of Israel.
\an (Note: The introduction to the Old Testament quote/quotation in the translation here may need to state that the prophet said/wrote this about a place in the Bethlehem area. The original readers would have known that Ramah and Bethlehem were (located in) the same area.)
\an (Also note: Rachel, who died many, many years before this was written, was buried in that area. Since she (being Isaac's wife) was viewed as the mother of all Jewish people, she is described in this poetry as crying for the children. However, it is her Jewish descendants many generations later, who lived in that area, who actually wept. In the translation of this fulfillment it may be necessary to speak of the descendants of Rachel mourning and weeping for their children just as Rachel had mourned long ago. You will probably want to keep the Old Testament context of the quote/quotation in mind, too, as you work on this.)

\rf Matthew 2:19-23 Joseph, Mary and Jesus returned from Egypt.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 2.19-23

\tqe He took his family and went to live at/in Nazareth in the Galilee district. (22-23)

\tqe Since Jesus lived at Nazareth, people would tend to call him a "Nazarene". By doing that, they fulfilled what one of the prophets had foretold, saying/writing that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene. (23)

\tqe He was one who lived simply and he proclaimed God's message. (He was much like the Old Testament prophets.)
\bttq What did John the Baptist do?
\tqe He told the people that there was a much more important person among them, whom they should follow, namely Jesus. He told them all to repent and obey God, since the time when God would rule them was near. (1-12)
\dh Details
\tqref MAT 3.1-3
\bttq What do you think Matthew meant when he wrote that John the Baptist "came" or "appeared"?
\tqe He did not mean that John came to a certain place, but that he came into the public view, that is, he appeared on the scene, doing a public ministry. (1)
\bttq From what Matthew wrote, when do you think he "came," [or "appeared"]?
\tqe The words of verse 1, "In those days", refers to the time while Jesus still lived at Nazareth. (1)
\an (Note: We know that these events mentioned here in this text occurred many years after Jesus started living at Nazareth. At that time Jesus and John would have both been about 30 years old.)
\bttq John the Baptist told people to repent in verse 2. What do you think it means when someone repents?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that the person regrets his sins and unbelief, turns from them and follows God. (See "repent" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think John meant when he said that the kingdom of heaven was near?
\tqe Key Term Check: The English word kingdom is used here in its nearly obsolete meaning of kingship. It refers to the fact of God's ruling in people's lives rather than referring to the area of the earth over which he rules. The meaning here is that the King [that is, Jesus,] was near, that the time when God will rule over people (in a special way) was to occur soon. (See "kingdom of heaven" in KBT.)
\bttq About whom was Isaiah talking/writing when he predicted many years before, that someone in a sparsely populated place would be calling out for people to prepare the road [or way] for the Lord's coming?
\tqe Isaiah referred to John the Baptist. (3)

\bttq What do you think Matthew wanted the people to learn by his telling them about the type of clothing and food that John used?

\tqe Yes, they were. (4-6)
\bttq How can we tell?
\tqe Matthew wrote that people from the whole surrounding area went to hear/and heard John's teaching. They confessed their sins, and he baptized them. (5-6)
\tqref MAT 3.7-10
\bttq What do you think was the reason that John was not glad that the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him to be baptized?
\tqe He was not glad because he knew that they did not come wanting/in pursuit of a right relationship with God. They were just acting as though they agreed with John's teaching about repenting and worshipping God so that others would think well of them. (7-10)
\bttq What do you know about Pharisees?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Pharisees were the largest and most important of the Jewish religious groups. They controlled the synagogues and exercised great control over the general population. They taught that the way to God was through obeying the law. They opposed Jesus because He refused to accept the teachings of their oral law. (See "Pharisee" in KBT.)
\bttq Who do you think the Sadducees were?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Sadducees were another religious party of the Jews. (See "Sadducee" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think John meant when he said they needed to produce the kind of fruit that comes from people who truly repent?
\tqe He meant that they needed to really change their attitude toward God and show it by their actions. (8)
\bttq What was wrong with considering themselves the descendants of Abraham when they really were his descendants?
\tqe They mistakenly hoped that God would have to accept them no matter what they did, since they were Abraham's descendants. (This can be understood from the immediate as well as the broader context.)
\bttq What do you think John meant when he said that God could make stones into children for/of Abraham if he wanted?
\tqe He was saying that, if God needed children for/of Abraham, he could easily do it by making them from stones. (9)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that John talked about cutting down trees that did not bear good fruit?
\tqe John was showing that God wanted people who will truly serve him. He will treat those who will not serve him as/in the same manner that men do their fruit trees that do not produce good fruit. They cut them down and burn them. (Context of 7-10 and broader NT context.)
\tqref MAT 3.11-12
\bttq Who do you think was the one who would soon appear?
\tqe Jesus was the one who would soon appear. (11)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that John might have felt that he was unfit to even carry (or untie) Jesus' sandals?
\tqe He might have felt that way because he knew who Jesus was. He felt unworthy to do anything for Jesus. (11)
\bttq What did John think about his water baptism as compared to Jesus' kind of baptism?
\tqe John showed that he knew Jesus' baptism was more important/much greater. (11)
\bttq What do you think it means when someone is baptized?
\tqe Key Term Check: "Baptism" is the outward sign by which a person's commitment to and union with Jesus Christ are publicly demonstrated. (See "baptize" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think John was talking about when he mentioned that Jesus would baptize people with the Holy Spirit?
\tqe He was talking about Jesus sending the Holy Spirit to be with his people. (11)
\an (Note: The change that the Holy Spirit would bring in people's lives would, like water baptism, be a sign to other people that they were now following God.)
\bttq When John said that Jesus would "baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire", what do you think he meant by "fire"? (This is a check for any obviously wrong meaning.)
\tqe There are different possible interpretations of what John meant.
\tqe In the Bible:
\tqe  l) Fire is used figuratively to indicate purification, since fire is sometimes used to burn up less costly and less permanent elements, while leaving the valuable elements unharmed. This purification figure is commonly applied/used to apply to Christians in the New Testament.
\tqe  2) Fire is used to indicate punishment/judgment from God by association with the pain of burning. Such punishment/judgment would usually apply to non-believers in the New Testament.
\an (Note: From John's concern that, at least some of them, might depend on their status of being descendants of Abraham and miss God's blessing, he could be referring to some of them as being baptized with the Holy Spirit and others being baptized with fire. This would then make fire here mean about the same as in verses 10 and 12, where it means judgment/punishment.)
\bttq While he was speaking to the Pharisees and Sadducees, what do you think is the reason that John talked about God winnowing everything on his threshing floor—saving the wheat and burning the chaff?
\an He was telling them to truly repent and to change their actions, so that they would not be punished.
\bttq What kind of fire did John say God would use to burn up the chaff/unusable part?
\tqe God would use fire that could not be extinguished/put out. (12)

\bttq What happened when Jesus was baptized?

\bttq Who else could this opponent be?
\an This opponent could be God himself.
\an (Note: Jesus was teaching about our relationship with God, so he was not suddenly switching to speaking of/talking about avoiding people in the local court here at the end of this section. Rather, he is using figurative language to make a strong rhetorical point. He is saying, "Do not be in a wrong relationship with God, lest you find yourself in court with him and not be able to satisfy the penalty for your wrong doing." Emphasizing the inability to pay the penalty may help to make this point clearer in the translation.)

\tqe No, he did not mean that.
\bttq What did he mean?
\tqe Jesus again is using rhetoric that his hearers would have understood. He meant for us to think how very serious sin is and to stop doing it. (In fact, gouging out one eye would not help much, since there would still be an eye left. The same is true of cutting off an arm.) Thinking how serious sin really is, though, should help a person to obey God, so that he can help that person.

\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus said that loving their enemies would make them sons of their father in heaven?
\tqe Loving their enemies would not make them into children of God, but it would demonstrate to others that they were children of God. The people to whom he was talking here were already related to God, as we can tell by the fact that he called God their Father. The terms "son of" and "daughters of," in that culture, were often used to mean "a typical representative of." Compare the term "daughters of Jerusalem" which they used to talk about typical women of Jerusalem. (45)

\bttq What did Jesus say would happen, if a person seeks praise from others when he gives to needy people?

\tqe He wanted to warn his hearers not to be like hypocrites. (5-8)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he said that the hypocrites had already received all of their reward for praying?

The only help they receive is when people praise them. // The only advantage they would receive for having said the prayers publicly, would be the praises of people. (5-6)
\bttq Should our prayers be long, short, or what, according to verses 7 and 8?
\tqe We should not try to make our prayers long with meaningless words and phrases or a lot of repetition. Our prayers do not need to be long, since God already knows what we need before we ask. (7-8)
\bttq Do you think Jesus meant that the prayer he suggested/suggested prayer he gave is the only way to pray?

\tqe He said that they should pray that the time of his ruling over people on earth would soon happen. (10)
\bttq What did he want his disciples' goal to be as they prayed concerning God ruling on earth?
\tqe Their goal should be for people here on earth to obey God fully, as the heavenly beings/angels already obey him. (10)
\bttq What did he recommend that his disciples ask concerning their own needs?
\tqe They should ask that God would supply their need for each day as it approached. (11)
\bttq What did Jesus show in his prayer as an appropriate way for his disciples to ask God to forgive them?
\tqe They could ask God to forgive the wrong they did as they themselves were forgiving the wrong others did to them. (12)
\bttq What do you think happens when a person/someone forgives someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: Forgiveness always involves two people, one of whom has done something wrong to the other and offended him. Forgiveness takes place when the one, who was offended, sets aside his right to justice and decides not to punish the offender, as he deserved. If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offense, is restored and the guilt of the offender is removed. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Jesus suggest as one appropriate way to pray so that God would keep them from sinning?
\tqe They could ask God to protect them from being tempted (beyond what they could withstand) and thus God would rescue them from evil/the evil one. (13)
\bttq Who do you think the evil one is?
\tqe Key Term Check: The "evil one" is another name for Satan. (See "evil one" in KBT in the "Satan" entry.)

\bttq Would God be pleased with people who fasted just to make other people think that they were seriously worshipping God?
\tqe No. That would not make God happy.
\bttq What gain did Jesus say such people earn/achieve from fasting like that?
\tqe He said that the only thing they would gain from such fasting would be the attention of those other people. (16)
\bttq What should we do then, if we decide to fast?
\tqe We should dress and wash ourselves as usual, so that only God knows that we are fasting.
\tqe Since God knows everything, he will know what we are doing and can bless us. (17-18)

\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by earthly treasure?
\tqe He meant anything on earth that people value and which might distract them from maintaining/continuing their relationship with God.
\bttq What is the reason that Jesus does not want us to spend much time and great effort in accumulating/to accumulate many possessions here on earth?
\tqe The things that people/we value here on earth are not long lasting, and they will tend to distract people/us from the/our lifetime goal of loving and serving God. (20-21)
\bttq What is the purpose of our eyes?
\tqe We see with our eyes and they show the rest of the body the way we want/the person wants to go. (22)
\bttq What, then, is the difference between a good eye and a bad eye for the body?
\tqe With a good eye the person can see where he wants to go. If our/a person's eye is bad, we/he cannot see where he wants/we want to go. (22-23)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he spoke of a person having a "good eye" and when he spoke of a person having a "bad eye"?
\tqe A person who can see is like a person who has a heart to know God. A person who can not see is like a person who has a heart not to know God and not to do his will.
\bttq What did Jesus say about a person trying to serve two masters?
\tqe Jesus said that if a person tries to serve two masters, he will always have more devotion for one master than for the other. Therefore, by neglecting one of the two masters, he will not be serving that one at all. (24)

\an (Note: This is implied.)
\bttq If the translation still says so, then ask: How can a day actually be able to think enough to worry?
\tqe Of course, a day cannot think or worry. The meaning is that there will be a certain amount of concern for us each day [also God will provide daily for us]. So we/people should not worry ahead of time. (34)

\bttq What do you think is the reason that the centurion told Jesus that he obeyed his superiors and also that those whom he commanded obeyed his orders?

\tqe Jesus probably wanted to cross to the other side of the lake because people had been with him for some time and he needed to get away from the crowd for a time of rest.
\bttq About whom do you think Jesus was speaking when he spoke of "the Son of Man" in verse 20?
\tqe Key Term Check: Jesus was speaking about himself. "Son of Man" is a title/one of the titles Christ used of Himself. (See "son of man" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he said that he had no place to lay his head?
\tqe He meant that the man, who asked, might not be happy staying with him, since he had no home of his own, but/and moved from place to place. (20)
\bttq What do you think about the other man who was one of Jesus disciples? How long do you think it might have been before he returned to follow Jesus, if Jesus had said it was all right for him to go first and do what he wanted to do? Then he could return to become Jesus' disciple.

\bttq What did Jesus mean when he said to let dead people bury their own dead people?

\bttq If the translated text uses a question for what Jesus says in verse 4 and/or verse 5 then ask: Do you think Jesus expected the people to answer his question(s)?
\an No, he did not.
\an (Note: He asked those question(s) to make them start thinking. In verse 4 he was simply saying, with emphasis, that they should not think as they were. They should be willing to accept Jesus as one sent from God.)
\bttq What do you think about verse 5? What was Jesus telling them by asking which was easier to say, "I forgive your sins." or "Get up and walk"?

\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 9.9-13
\bttq What kind of work did Matthew do before Jesus called him to follow him?
\tqe He was a tax collector. (9)
\an (Note: The Jews thought that tax collectors were dishonest people because many of them charged/collected/took more tax than the government required, then kept the extra money for themselves. Also, people did not like them because they collected for the Roman government, which had occupied/taken over Israel by force.)
\dh Details
\bttq What did the Pharisees think about Jesus eating with tax collectors and others, whom the Pharisees called sinners?
\tqe They thought that Jesus should not eat with them. (10-11)
\bttq What is the reason that Jesus thought it was all right for him to mix with such people?
\tqe Jesus' idea was that, if people were bad, they needed help from God. (He referred to them as sick people needing a doctor.) (12)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that, right in the middle of this/his talk/teaching about his eating with sinners, Jesus talked about mercy being better than making sacrifices?
\tqe Jesus talked about the/our need to be merciful to others, at that time, because the Pharisees were proud of doing all of the culturally right religious acts; but they were not kind to other people, including the sinners in their midst. Also they were trying to stop Jesus from being kind to those sinners. (Their religious acts included sacrificing animals.) (13)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to show mercy to someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: "Mercy" in the New Testament is an act of kindness by God or by a person
\an to/toward someone else. (See "mercy" in KBT.)

The gift is given in order to establish, maintain, or restore a proper relationship between the sacrificer and the deity. Something is given up in order to achieve a purpose. (See "sacrifice" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus told them that he came to call sinners and not righteous people?
\tqe He said that because he came to help people who were not in/did not have a right relationship with God. (Also probably because the scribes and Pharisees (who were talking to him) called themselves "righteous people." They would not admit their need or come to ask him to forgive their sins.) (13)
\bttq What did Jesus want the scribes and Pharisees to learn?
\tqe He wanted them to learn that God wants them to have compassion on others, rather than giving gifts to him. (13)

\tqe Jesus compared his disciples to the friends of a bridegroom who are happy to be with the bridegroom. They would not refuse to eat (which was a sign of sorrow), when the bridegroom was there with them. (15)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus mentioned the bridegroom being taken away from his friends?

\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus had taught his disciples about when to fast and when not to fast?
\tqe Probably he had taught them not to just follow traditions without thinking about what they were doing. They should fast when there was a reason to fast. (15)
\tqref MAT 9.16-17

\tqe He said that people do not repair an old garment with a piece of new cloth. (16)
\bttq Do people you know sometimes repair an old garment with a piece of new cloth?
\an (Note: Check for possible mismatch with local practice. At least Jesus and his hearers did not usually patch new cloth onto old cloth.)
\bttq What was the second thing Jesus said people do not do?
\tqe He said that they did not put new wine in an old goatskin (old leather bottle). (17)
\an (Note: Check that the point of the illustration itself is clear. When someone seals new wine in a non-pliable leather container, the wine will swell while fermenting. That will cause the container to break and result in a total loss of the contents/wine.)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus spoke here about cloth, and about the wine and about hardened leather containers/bottles? What was he teaching the people?
\tqe He taught them that his teachings could not be a part of their old teachings/traditions/traditional system. They needed to change what they believed and also to change their way of worshipping God. (16-17)

\tqe They laughed because he said that the girl was not dead, but (only) asleep. They knew she was dead. (24)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus (might have) said that the girl was sleeping when she was (really/already) dead?
\tqe He knew her condition was temporary, since he was at the point of bringing/about to bring her back to life. (24)

\bttq What is the reason that they were not to take such things with them?
\tqe They were not to take such things with them because his disciples were going out to help/serve others, and those to whom they went to help/serve were to supply their needs. (10)
\tqref MAT 10.11-15
\bttq What sort of household were they to find to stay while they taught and healed in a particular area?
\tqe They were to find a household where the people were worthy to have them stay with them. They/Those would be people who realized the true value of the message the disciples were bringing. (11)
\bttq What sort of greeting (salute) were they to give to home owners when they entered their homes?
\tqe They were to greet the home owners with "[May God give you] peace." (12-13)
\an (Note: It may be necessary to add the implied "may God give you" in the translation here.)
\bttq What did Jesus say that they were to do if the household or village rejected them after they had greeted them with the proper greeting?
\tqe They were to realize that the greeting of God's peace, or "God will help you live well," was not the correct message for those people. Then they were to proceed to treat them as the Jews usually treated outsiders who did not follow God. They were to shake the dust of that home or village from their feet to demonstrate to those people that they were acting in a way that would not allow them to receive anything from God. (12-14)
\an (Note: In the Jewish manner of speaking/way of talking about this they would speak/talk of the disciples "taking the peace back to themselves." In English we could say, "In that case, take back your greeting." We could demonstrate the seriousness of what they have done by shaking their dust off of our feet.)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus mentioned the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah here?
\tqe He mentioned those towns because his hearers knew, from the Old Testament, that the people of those two towns had rejected God's ways; and God had destroyed them. (15)
\an (Note: You may need to add implied information here so that the readers understand better what Jesus meant by speaking of Sodom and Gomorrah.)
\tqref MAT 10.16-20
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he talked about sheep and wolves and about the disciples needing to be, in some ways, like snakes and doves?
\tqe He meant that some of the people, that they would see, would be (just) waiting to harm them. So for that reason they needed to have a good plan of action to escape danger. Snakes were viewed as having that ability, but they were not to harm anyone, just as doves do not harm anyone. (16)
\bttq What is the reason that he told the disciples to watch out/be careful, and to have only good motives?
\tqe They were to be careful because people would bring them before the local Jewish council meeting in the synagogue and have them beaten. (17)
\bttq What is the reason that people would take them to the courts of kings and governors?
\tqe They would be representing Jesus, so people who were hostile to Jesus would take them to court. (18)
\bttq What would happen when they were in court before the Kings?
\tqe Kings, governors and people of the various nations would hear their testimony about Jesus as they spoke in court. (18)
\bttq What is the reason that they should not worry about what to say if they were (being) brought to court for serving Jesus?
\tqe They were not to be worried about what to say in the court session because God's spirit would help them to know what to say to the leaders/officials as they were in the act of speaking. (19-20)
\tqref MAT 10.21-25
\bttq After reading verses 2l-25, can you think why some men would turn their own brothers over to the authorities to be killed? Or why some parents would take their own children and have them put to death? Or why some children would take their own parents and have them put to death?
\tqe Because family members, who did not love or believe/follow Jesus, would be so very much against those who believed/followed him that they would accuse them before leaders to have them killed. Local leaders had called Jesus, Beelzebub, that is Satan, so of course they would not like his believers/people/followers either. The believers/his people/followers needed to be ready to be rejected. (21-25)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he said "brother" in verse 21?
\tqe Key Term Check: In this verse, Jesus meant brother to be someone who is a biological brother.

\an (Note: This was not a difficult saying for the disciples to understand. It would have been very clear to them.)
\tqref MAT 10.26-31
\bttq Whom were they not to fear?
\tqe They were not to fear those who called Jesus, Beelzebub, in verse 25. That is, they were not to fear the Jewish religious leaders.
\bttq What is the reason that they should not fear?
\tqe They were not to fear because God would judge those leaders for whatever they did to them, when/at the time he judges all people. He might even judge them before that final judgment day. (26)
\bttq About what was Jesus talking when he mentioned his speaking to them "in the dark" and "whispering in their ears"?
\tqe He was referring to what he said to them privately. (27)
\bttq About what was he talking when he referred to their "speaking in the daylight" and "proclaiming from the house tops"?
\tqe He was saying that they needed to proclaim the message, that/which he had taught them privately, to the people publicly/out among the people so that everyone would hear it. (27)
\bttq Do you think Jesus thought that would be a dangerous thing for them to do?
\tqe Yes, he did.
\bttq Why?
\tqe Because after he told them to proclaim the message, he told them again not to fear people who could only kill a person's body. (27-28)
\bttq Whom did he say they should fear?
\tqe They should rather be afraid to forsake/offend the one who can cause people to die, as well as cause them to be punished in hell. (28)
\bttq Who do you think that is?
\tqe He was speaking/talking about God. (The one who can send people to hell for punishment/to be punished.)
\bttq What do you know about hell?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is a place where those who have rejected the Lord will spend eternity. It is a place where there is constant pain and darkness. (See "hell" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus started speaking of/talking about sparrows?
\tqe He mentioned sparrows because he wanted them to know that God, who watches over rather insignificant parts of his creation, like sparrows, will certainly watch over his people. (29-31)
\bttq Who knows the number of the hair on our heads?
\tqe God does/knows. (This is implied.) (30)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus mentioned that fact here?
\tqe He was showing that, if God knows these details, then he can take care of/protect us even down to each hair. We do not need to be afraid. (30-31)
\tqref MAT 10.32-33
\bttq After talking about how they should not be afraid of people, what was Jesus trying to make plain to his disciples in verses 32 and 33?
\tqe They needed to acknowledge/confess/admit to being his people, so that he could state to the Father that they were his people. (32-33)
\tqref MAT 10.34-36
\bttq People who lived at the time Jesus was here on earth were thinking that the Messiah's (Christ's) kingdom would bring peace on the earth. Did Jesus say that would happen since he had come?
\tqe No. He said that his having come would cause strife. (34)
\bttq What do you think it means to be at peace?
\tqe Key Term Check: To be at peace is to have a mental or spiritual condition marked by freedom from disquieting or oppressive thoughts or emotions.
\bttq About what sort of strife was Jesus talking?
\tqe He said that people who were of the same household would be against one another [because some would choose to believe/follow him and the others would hate them]. (35-36)
\tqref MAT 10.37-39
\bttq In such a case will it be all right with Jesus for people to do as their relatives do, who will have nothing to do with Jesus, to keep peace in the family?
\tqe No, it will not be all right.
\bttq Why will it not be all right?
\tqe It will not be all right because Jesus said that, if people cared more for their family than for him, then they were not worthy of being one of his people/counted as his. (37)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant in verse 38, when he said people needed to carry their cross and follow him?
\tqe Key Term Check: Jesus meant that people, who wanted to follow him, needed to be willing to die in order to be a faithful follower of his/him. (See "cross" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Jesus mean by what he said in verse 39?
\tqe People who try to save themselves from any troubles or from death by not obeying him will lose their chance to have life eternal. Those who are willing to die on earth in order to follow him will have life eternal. (39)
\tqref MAT 10.40-42
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by the word "receive" when he said, "whoever receives you receives me"?
\tqe It is a bit difficult to know if the first reference here is to receiving them into their homes, or if Jesus is now referring mostly to people receiving rather than rejecting them and their message. However, those who would receive them because they are Jesus' disciples, would almost certainly receive them in all the above manners/ways. (40-42)
\bttq Jesus said that when they receive his disciples, they are at the same time receiving him and also the one who sent him. Whom do you think people, who read the translation, will think Jesus meant when he said, "the one who sent me"?
\tqe They should understand that Jesus meant God his father. (Implied) (40)
\bttq How will Jesus reward those who are good to people who serve God?
\tqe He will reward them in the same manner that he will reward those servants of his whom they help. (41)
\bttq Will God notice even rather insignificant help to his newest followers by rewarding the one who helped them?
\tqe Yes, he will notice. Even down to a drink of water. (42)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that God rewards such people?
\tqe He will reward them because they are the ones who truly follow him. (40)
\an (Note: This answer comes from the context and draws the passage together somewhat, but would be difficult to elicit/obtain from a respondent to these questions, who was reading the passage for the first time (the ideal kind). See especially verses 13 and l4 and verse 40. Jesus' coming caused people to make a choice for or against him as seen in verse 34 and following/and subsequent verses/onward.)

\bttq How did Jesus answer John's question when he sent his reply?
\tqe Jesus gave evidence that he was sent by God. That is, he was doing the various types of miracles predicted of the Messiah who was to come, including raising dead people back to life. (4-6)
\tqref MAT 11.7-15
\bttq When John's disciples left, where do you think they went?

\tqe Jesus began to talk to them about John the Baptist. (7)
\bttq To what occasion do you suppose Jesus was referring when he spoke to the people there about their going out into the desert at a previous time?
\tqe Jesus was talking about the time when they went out from the towns to the sparsely settled area in order to hear John the Baptist teach and to be baptized by him. (9-11)
\bttq What do you think most people, who read verse 7, would think Jesus meant when he asked if they had gone out to see a reed bent back and forth by the wind?
\tqe In Jesus' question he was asking them if they had found John to be an easily influenced person who was like a tall thin reed that bends different ways according to which way the wind was blowing/coming. (7)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus asked if they had gone out to see someone in fine clothes?
\tqe He probably asked that because their other religious leaders wore fine clothes, but John was different. (8)
\bttq In verse 9, what do you think Jesus meant when he said that John was a prophet and more than a prophet?
\tqe He meant that John was truly a prophet; but he was not just a prophet, he was a special prophet. (9)
\bttq In verse 10, who do you think spoke, and to whom was he speaking?
\tqe It is clear from the Old Testament and the way the Old Testament quotation/quote is used here that it was God speaking to his son, the Messiah. (10)
\bttq What can we learn from that Old Testament quotation given here in verse 10? What was so special about John that Jesus said he was "more than a prophet"?
\tqe From the Old Testament/this quotation we learn that John was the messenger whom God sent to precede the Messiah in order to prepare the people to receive the Messiah. (10)
\bttq In verse 11 Jesus continued talking about how important John was. To whom did Jesus compare John when he said that John was the greatest among them?
\tqe He compared John to everyone who had been born before/up until that time. (Except Jesus himself. Since he was the speaker, he could omit himself from the comparison.) (11)
\bttq What did Jesus say had been happening since the time John preached his message?
\tqe There are several interpretations:
\tqe 1. The kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing and people of power have been trying to use it for their own personal advantage.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe 2. From the time John the Baptist began preaching and baptizing, eager multitudes have been pressing/thronging into the kingdom. (12)
\an (Note: There doesn't seem to be a conclusive interpretation of this verse. NIV favors the second one.)
\bttq Before John the baptizer had come, how did the people know how God wanted them to live?
\tqe They knew by the Law [of Moses] and [the writings of] the Prophets [which had been read and taught to them as their guide for living]. (13)

\bttq How did Jesus compare the people of that time with the children who would not respond to the other children who were playing their flutes and singing songs?
\tqe Jesus said that the people of that time were like the children who would not dance, when other children tried to interact with them by playing [wedding songs] on their flutes.
\tqe Jesus said that the people of that time were like the children who would not mourn/cry, when other children tried to interact with them by singing [funeral] songs. (16-17)
\bttq How was that comparison in verses 16 and 17 like the way many of the people of John's and Jesus' time acted?

\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 11.20-24
\bttq What did Jesus say to the people of Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum?
\tqe He condemned/accused those people because, although/even though they saw the miracles that he did, they would not repent. (20)
\dh Details
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus expressed anger and said there would be suffering for the people of Chorazin and the people of Bethsaida?
\tqe The people from those two areas saw his miracles, but they did not repent as the non-Jews of that time, who lived in Tyre and Sidon, would have repented completely. (21)
\tqe The people to whom Jesus was speaking knew that God had destroyed the people of Sodom because of their great wickedness.
\an (Note: It may be necessary to make reference to their wickedness in the translation by a footnote to make Jesus' meaning clear here if the fact of their wickedness is not known by the readers.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would have happened if the miracles that had been done in Capernaum would have been done in Sodom?
\tqe Jesus said that if those miracles had been done in Sodom, it would still be in existence today. (23)

\dh Details
\bttq For what did Jesus praise his Father?
\tqe He praised God because he had given understanding concerning "these things" to humble people, but not to the wise people. (25-26)
\bttq What do you think were some of the important values/teachings the "ordinary ones" understood more than the "wise"?
\tqe The ordinary people understood that John was God's prophet to prepare people for the Messiah's coming; and that Jesus was the Messiah sent from God. With this kind of understanding they could repent and become people of God's kingdom. (1-25)
\an (Note: Don't expect new hearers of the text to necessarily produce all of the parts of this answer; but if they do, great. For some difficult questions, part of the questioning process is to eliminate any far out, wrong answers that do not agree with scripture. Here the "these things" refers back to general discussion in the context concerning the Kingdom of God and the introduction of the Messiah king. It is difficult to know exactly what all is covered by "these things" here. The context in that sentence helps by showing that it takes a simple humble spirited person, helped by God, to understand. This indicates that "these things" are spiritual matters. Then we look for spiritual matters which individuals need to understand in this context. This searching back is going to be difficult for anyone with only a rather quick going over of the text. Rereading verse l-25, after the question is read, may help. The meaning may need to be made more explicit.)
\bttq From verses 25 and 26, what do think it was that Jesus said pleased God the father?
\tqe It says that it pleased the Father to give special understanding concerning who Jesus really was to the humble, less educated people than to the supposedly wise highly educated people. (25-26)

\bttq What did Jesus say about the responsibility he would give to them, compared to what they had been experiencing/having?
\tqe He said it would be relatively easy for them. (30)
\bttq What responsibility do you think the people, to whom Jesus was speaking, had been feeling/experiencing?
\an They had the burden of trying to satisfy the requirements of the Old Testament law — the Ten Commandments, as well as all of the ceremonies of the Old Testament system. Then they often had to meet the demands of the "wise and learned" religious leaders of that time who did not have compassion on them or try to help them.

\tqe They said that the disciples were breaking the law by working on the day of rest. (2)
\tqref MAT 12.3-8
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus reminded them about what David did?
\tqe What David did was against God's/the laws given by Moses for carrying out the Jewish ceremonies. Thus, what David did was somewhat like the disciples/a lot like this situation with the disciples harvesting a bit of food on the rest day.
\bttq What had David done that was somewhat like/a bit like what the disciples were doing?
\tqe David had gone against the law concerning special bread that was kept in the temple. Only the priests were allowed to eat that bread. When he and his men had arrived at the temple hungry, he had asked the priest and received from him some of the special bread and ate it. He gave some of the bread to his men and they, too, ate some of it. (3-4)
\bttq Do you think it was justifiable/lawful/acceptable to God for David and his men to eat that special bread at that time?
\tqe Yes, it was.
\bttq What do you think is the reason that it was lawful/acceptable to God/permissible?
\tqe David and his men were truly hungry and there was no other food. (3)
\bttq From reading verse 5, do you think Jesus thought the Pharisees had or had not read the part in the Old Testament law that said that the priests could work in the temple area on the Sabbath? Or did he think that they had not read that part, since that portion of the Old Testament said that they could work on the Sabbath, and it would not be sin for them?
\tqe He assumed that they had read it. He was just reminding them of another case when it was all right for people to do some work on the Sabbath. (5)
\bttq Who or what did Jesus say was more important than the temple?
\tqe He himself was more important than the temple.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe  The kingdom of God for which he and his disciples were working was greater than the temple.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He and the kingdom of God were greater than the temple. If work could be carried out on the Sabbath for the temple service, how much more it could be done for him and/or for God's kingdom which they were promoting. (6)
\bttq What did Jesus say the Pharisees did not understand?
\tqe Jesus said that the Pharisees did not understand what God meant when he said that he desired that people have mercy on others. But rather they were ruthless to others; and then later they sought God's forgiveness when they had not been merciful to others. (7)
\bttq What people would the Pharisees not have condemned, if they had understood and obeyed the way God wanted them to be merciful?
\tqe They would have been merciful and not spoken out against Jesus' disciples for picking grains of wheat/harvesting food when they were hungry. (7)
\bttq What do you think it means when a person condemns someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: When a person condemns someone else he pronounces the other person guilty of committing a crime and declares that the person will be punished for what he has done. (See "condemn" in KBT in the "judge, judgment" entry.)
\bttq About whom was Jesus talking when he mentioned the Son of Man?
\tqe He was talking about himself. (8)
\bttq What did he say about himself then?

\tqref MAT 12.9-14
\bttq When Jesus went into the synagogue who was there?
\tqe A man with a withered hand was there. (9-10)
\bttq What is the reason that the Pharisees asked Jesus if it was lawful/all right to heal on the Sabbath day?
\tqe They wanted to see if they could dare/provoke him to say or do something that would give them a reason to accuse him of working on the Sabbath. (10)
\bttq How did Jesus answer them?
\tqe He said that if any of them had a sheep which fell into a large/big hole on the Sabbath, they would pull it out, which was work (as the Old Testament said they could do on the Sabbath). Then he said that people are much more valuable than sheep, so it is lawful to/all right by God's law to do good to people on the Sabbath day as well. (11-12)
\bttq Then what did Jesus say to the man?
\tqe He told him to stretch out his hand. (13)
\bttq Then what happened?
\tqe While he was stretching out his hand Jesus healed it. (13)
\bttq What did the Pharisees do after that/then?
\tqe They went from there and began/started planning together how they could kill Jesus. (14)

That promise was that God's chosen Servant, the Messiah, would be revealed to them; and Matthew wanted to emphasize that Jesus must truly be the predicted Christ for whom they had been waiting. (17-21)
\bttq What are some of the characteristics/attributes that God mentioned about his chosen servant which Matthew quoted in verses l8-2l?
\tqe The attributes which God mentioned about his chosen servant include the following:

\tqe 2. His servant pleased him. (18)
\tqe 3. God said that he would give his Spirit to him. (18)

\rf Matthew 12:22-37 The Pharisees said that Jesus was using the power of Beelzebub, the chief of evil spirits, to drive evil spirits out of people.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 12.22-37
\bttq Did Jesus agree with the Pharisees when they thought that he had an agreement with Beelzebub? They said/thought that he had an agreement with Beelzebub/that Beelzebub gave him power to cast out demons like the one that kept the man from seeing and not being able to speak.
\tqe No, he did not agree with them.
\bttq What were some of the details/incidents/points Jesus used to show that he did not have an agreement with Beelzebub to cast out demons?
\tqe He told them that any group that divides into two sides, and those sides start working against each other, will not last very long. Therefore, Beelzebub would not do that against his own demons. (25-26)
\tqe He said that, if it takes an agreement with Satan to cast out demons, then how was it that some of their own people claimed to cast out demons. (27)
\bttq What did Jesus say it would prove to people if they realized that he really had cast out demons?
\tqe It would show that he truly was the offspring of king David. Therefore they could know that God was ruling over them. (28)
\dh Details
\tqref MAT 12.22-29
\bttq What was wrong with the man whom the people brought to Jesus?
\tqe He was blind and could not speak. (22)
\bttq What do you think Jesus did to heal the man?
\tqe Jesus must have cast one or more demons out of the man. (22)
\bttq What did the people, who were watching, think when he caused the man to be able to see and speak?
\tqe They were amazed that he could do that. (23)
\bttq What did they think was the reason that Jesus could do such things?
\tqe They were thinking that he must be the offspring of David, that is the Messiah, whom the prophets had said God would send to them someday. (23)
\bttq Did the leaders of the Pharisees agree with the people that Jesus must be the Messiah for whom they had been waiting?
\tqe No, they did not agree. (24)
\bttq What did the Pharisees say about the miracles that Jesus performed/did?
\tqe They said that Jesus could only cure such a demon possessed man by making an agreement with Beelzebub, the leader of the demons, who then permitted/gave authority to him/allowed him to cast out the demons. (24)
\bttq Who is this Beelzebub?
\tqe That is what they called the leader of the demons, who is usually called Satan. (24)
\bttq How do you think Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking?
\tqe He had often heard them talking and probably he could tell from the looks on their faces, something about their attitude toward him at that time. Also he is God so he knows everything.
\bttq Who was the strong man Jesus was really talking about in these verses?
\tqe Jesus was referring to Satan. (29)
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he said that you have to tie up a strong man well before you can rob from his house?
\tqe He was saying/teaching them that Satan would not allow just anyone to cast out the demons that are controlled by him. That is, Jesus is more powerful than Satan. (29)
\tqref MAT 12.30-32
\bttq What did Jesus want people to understand by what he said in verse 30?
\tqe People either decide for Jesus and help him gather people to himself; or else, they are helping Satan by discouraging people from following Jesus. (30)
\bttq Can you think of something which/that the Pharisees did that would have caused Jesus to talk in that manner/like that?
\tqe The response of the Pharisees was that he could only do that because he had a connection with Satan. By being against Jesus, the Pharisees were discouraging people from following Jesus. (24, 30)
\bttq When they/people read this, what kind of sins do you think they/people should expect that God will forgive, or will not forgive?
\tqe They should expect that God will forgive all kinds of sin, but deliberately defaming the Holy Spirit is very dangerous. It is possible to sin in such a way/commit a sin which/do something that God can never forgive. (32)
\bttq Will God forgive people who defame other people?
\tqe Yes, God will forgive people who defame other people, according to verse 31.
\bttq What sin will God forgive according to verse 32?
\tqe Verse 32 states/relates/says that God/he will forgive people who defame the Son of Man. (This phrase "son of man" can be understood as parallel to verse 31 with the same meaning as the word "man" in that verse. But probably it is better to understand Jesus to be referring to a specific man, that is, himself, Jesus the Messiah (in his human form) here in verse 32.
\bttq What does it say in verse 31 and 32 about those who defame the Holy Spirit?
\tqe It says that God will not forgive those who defame/speak against the Holy Spirit. (31-32)
\tqref MAT 12.33-37
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus talked about a good tree bearing good fruit and a bad tree bearing bad fruit?
\tqe It is our experience that a good tree will have good fruit and that a bad tree will have bad fruit. It just does not happen the other way around. Of course Jesus was pointing out that the same is true with people. (33)
\bttq Whom did Jesus call the offspring of vipers?
\tqe He was talking to the Pharisees or to the Pharisees plus any others who were there who thought as/in the same manner as they did. (34)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus called them the offspring of vipers/poisonous snakes?
\tqe He called them that because they were evil. (34)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by "careless words"?
\tqe He meant anything a person/people might say without first considering if what he/they said would result in good being done rather than bad being done. (36)
\bttq To what was Jesus referring when he talked about people being acquitted and about them being condemned?
\tqe He warned them to prepare themselves for God's final judgment. He said what a person says will make a great difference in whether God can accept that person or not accept them. (37)

\rf Matthew 12:38-45 The Pharisees and Teachers of the Law asked Jesus to do a sign/miracle for them.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 12.38-45
\bttq What did some of the Pharisees say that they wanted Jesus to do in verse 38?
\tqe They said that they wanted him to do something supernatural which they could see. That might prove to them that he had power from God. (38)
\bttq Since Jesus had just cured a man who had been blind and could not speak, what do you think was the reason that those Pharisees asked Jesus to do something miraculous?
\tqe They wanted him to prove that he had power from God. But also they asked that because they did not believe that he was the one sent from God (and they did not want to believe).
\dh Details
\bttq About whom was Jesus probably talking when he said, "this generation"?
\tqe The scribes and Pharisees were the ones who asked to see a sign/miracle. So he was talking about them, and probably also everyone else living at that time who had not believed in him, but who would hear of people killing him and of his coming to life again after three days. (39-41)
\bttq What do you think a sign/miracle is?
\tqe Key Term Check: A miracle/sign is an unusual event, which can only be explained as a special action by God (or, in some contexts, of some other supernatural power). (See "miracle, sign" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he called them an "adulterous" group of people?
\tqe He meant that they were breaking their covenant with God as/in the same manner as some people break their marriage promise or covenant. He meant that they were unfaithful to God and that they were doing evil. (39)
\bttq The "sign of Jonah" is mentioned in verses 39-41. What sort of sign was that?
\tqe Jonah was saved from drowning in the sea by God, who sent a sea monster to swallow him. After three days and nights the sea monster spewed/vomited/spit him out onto the land. Likewise he/Jesus would be resurrected from death after three days. (39-41) (See the OT text concerning Jonah.)
\bttq Whom did Jesus mean when he said that, 1. Something or, 2. Someone greater than Jonah was there?
\tqe 1. If we understand/consider what he said to mean "something greater than Jonah," then Jesus meant the message about the kingdom of God, a message greater than the one proclaimed by Jonah.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe 2. If we understand/consider what Jesus said to mean "someone greater than Jonah," then, of course, he would be referring to himself—the Messiah as being greater than the prophet Jonah. (41)
\bttq What did Jesus mean by his statement that, at the time of judgment, the people of Nineveh would be a witness against the Jewish people of Jesus' time?
\tqe He meant that the Nineveh people had repented when they were warned by Jonah, but the Jewish people of Jesus time refused to repent although/even though Jesus was greater than Jonah, the one who told the Ninevites to repent. (41)
\bttq If the translated text has "Queen of the South," without mentioning her country, Sheba, then ask: From where did the queen come?
\tqe The queen came from a country far south of where the Jews lived. (42)
\an (Note: It will probably be best to mention Sheba in the text or in a footnote so that the readers will know that she was not from Israel.) (42)
\bttq How will what the queen did testify against/convict the people of Jesus' generation, at the time when God judges the people of earth?
\tqe The Queen of Sheba came all the way to Israel in order to hear some of King Solomon's wisdom. The Jews of Jesus day refused to listen to the Messiah, who had much greater wisdom than Solomon had. Therefore, God will judge/punish them. (42)
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he talked about a number of unclean spirits coming and taking up residence where only one of them had been living previously?
\tqe He was warning the Jewish nation that it was about to happen to them, since they did not repent and did not truly turn to God. (43-45)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus talked about the evil spirit going through dry places/uninhabited places, as the evil spirit wandered around when it had no place to stay?
\tqe By speaking of dry places/uninhabited places, Jesus disclosed/revealed/showed that the evil spirit expected to find another person in whom he could live again. (43)
\bttq What do you think an evil spirit is?
\tqe Key Term Check: The terms "evil spirit", "unclean spirit", and "demon" are used interchangeably in the New Testament. They all refer to spiritual beings who serve Satan as his agents, being under his authority. These spiritual beings have power to oppress a human being and even to take control of him. (See "evil spirit" in KBT.)
\bttq In this account/his little story, Jesus said that the evil spirit left the person and later came back to that person, but whom was he really warning?
\tqe He was warning the people of Israel including the scribes and Pharisees of verse 38, who refused to believe Jesus. (45)

\rf Matthew 12:46-50 Those who believe Jesus are like a family to him.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 12.46-50
\bttq From these verses what do you think was the important point Matthew wanted us to understand?
\tqe Matthew wanted us to know that those, who please God, are special to Jesus like his own family.
\dh Details
\tqref MAT 12.46-47
\bttq Who came looking/to look for Jesus?
\tqe His mother and [younger] brothers came looking/to look for him. (46)
\bttq How did Jesus know that his mother and brothers were there?
\tqe People in the crowd around him told him. (47)
\tqref MAT 12.48-50
\bttq If there is a question in the translation at the beginning of verse 48, then ask the following two questions:
\bttq Was Jesus asking the people a question that he wanted them to answer?
\tqe No, he was not. (48)
\bttq What do you think he was doing?
\tqe He was gaining their attention, so that he could teach them. (48)
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he pointed to his disciples and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers"?
\tqe He meant that those, who do according to what God wants, are in close relationship to him, just like brothers, and sisters and a mother. (49-50)
\bttq Do you think that Jesus refused to go and talk to his own family?
\an Matthew did not tell us about that, but only about what Jesus was able to teach the people because of their coming to see him.
\an (Note: Jewish teachers used to begin/start with something that was happening and then teach something else from it. When the crowd mentioned family, Jesus started from that thought and taught about his close relationship to people who obey God. This was the important part/component of the teaching which Matthew wanted to emphasize. He did not bother to go back and tell us more about this incident and whether Jesus talked with his mother and brothers afterward or not. He probably did.)

\rf Matthew 13:1-9 Jesus told a parable about a farmer sowing seed.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 13.1-9
\bttq In this parable, what did Jesus say about the different seed that fell to the ground as the farmer was sowing his crop?
\tqe There was great variation in the soil on which that seed fell and the results were different with each kind of soil:
\tqe Some seed did not have a chance to sprout.
\tqe Some sprouted, but did not grow well.
\tqe Other seed sprouted and grew. Some of these plants produced one hundred grains of seed, some of these plants produced sixty grains of seed and some of these plants produced thirty grains of seed. (3-8)
\bttq What do you think a parable is?
\tqe Key Term Check: A parable is a story which shows its meaning indirectly by using picture language to make a comparison. The parts of the comparison are generally not explained. The listeners themselves must think much about the meaning hidden in each part of the picture language. Jesus taught spiritual truths in this story form. (See "parable" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Jesus teach the people about listening carefully to him?
\tqe He taught them to listen carefully and to follow the good message that they heard. (9)
\dh Details
\bttq How many people do you think might have been there that day?
\tqe Verse 2 states/indicates that there were large groups of people gathered around him. (2)
\bttq So what did Jesus do?
\tqe He got into the boat. (2)
\bttq What is the reason that he went into the boat?
\tqe He went into the boat, so that he could move away from the crowd, so everyone could see and hear him better, [as he taught them]. (2)
\bttq How did Jesus teach them?
\tqe He used parables to teach them various things. (3)
\bttq What was the topic of the main/most important parable?
\tqe This story was about a man who sowed seed in his field. (3)
\bttq How did the man plant/place/sow the seed for growing in his field?
\an (Note: Check whether the manner of sowing is clearly tossing/scattering, since some fell where people would not ordinarily plant seed, if they were to dig, plant and then cover it up.) (3)
\bttq What happened to some of the seed?
\tqe Some seed fell on the path at the edge of the field and the birds came and ate it. (4)
\bttq What happened to other seed?
\tqe Some seed fell on soil with rock underneath. It came up quickly, but its roots did not develop, so it wilted from the heat of the sun and dried up. (5-6)
\bttq Where did other seed fall?
\tqe Some seed fell where thorny weeds grew. Those weeds prevented the good seed from growing well, so it did not produce/bear anything. (7)
\bttq What happened to the other seed?
\tqe Other seed fell on good soil, grew well and produced a crop. Of those seeds that grew on the good soil, some produced thirty times more seed than was sown, some produced sixty times more seed than was sown and some produced one hundred times more seed than was sown. (8)
\bttq What did Jesus mean by what he said in verse 9?
\tqe He meant that they needed to think seriously about this parable so that they would understand it and be able to learn from its warning. (9)

\rf Matthew 13:10-17 Jesus explained the reason why he spoke in parables to those who were not his disciples.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 13.10-17
\bttq To whom did Jesus always tend to speak in parables?
\tqe Jesus always tended to speak in parables to the crowds of people. (10)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that he spoke to them mostly in parables?
\tqe He spoke to them mostly in parables because they did not want to hear what he taught them/would teach them nor did they want to accept/receive it and turn to God. (They would probably have rejected his message immediately and stopped coming to hear him, if he had talked to them in plain speech.) (11-15)
\dh Details
\bttq What did the disciples want to know about the way Jesus taught?
\tqe They wanted to know why he always spoke in parables to the crowds of people. (10)
\bttq What was Jesus' first reply to their question?
\tqe He said that God had given them an understanding of what previously had been unknown about God's kingdom/the way God would rule over people, but he had not given that understanding to other people. (11)
\bttq Verse 12 sounds like an often-repeated saying; and we know that Jesus used it on at least one other occasion, applied to something else. What do you think he meant in this verse?
\tqe Jesus was saying that God will give much more understanding of him and his kingdom to the people who already have some understanding. As for those who have almost no understanding of him and his kingdom, he will take way even the little that they do know. (12)
\an (Note: Check for any far out misunderstanding of this verse. Some possible meanings suggested by various sources are:
\an l) They have so little understanding of God, that at the time of God's judging of people, their understanding will be counted as nothing.
\an —OR—
\an 2) When he teaches in parables they will realize/see that their original views do not fit, but will still not understand nor be forgiven by God.
\an —OR—
\an 3) They will lose the Old Testament law, but they will not gain understanding of the new covenant nor be forgiven by God.)
\bttq What is the reason that he spoke to them in parables?
\tqe He spoke to them in parables because they saw him doing miracles, but they did not understand what they were seeing. And even though they heard Jesus' message, it did not mean anything to them. So he used parables, which was the right thing to do when speaking to a rather hostile audience who were not really trying to learn from him. (13)
\bttq How did what the prophet Isaiah said about the people of Israel fit what Jesus said about the crowds following him?
\tqe The people to whom Jesus spoke/The people about whom Isaiah wrote were set in their ways/calloused in heart and would not listen to the message Jesus wanted to tell them, nor learn from what he was doing among them. (14-15)
\bttq What is the reason that the people about whom Isaiah wrote and the people whom Jesus was teaching did not want to respond to God's message?
\tqe If they had listened, they would have learned from the message and understood in their hearts what he was teaching them. Then they would have turned to him and he would have placed/put them in a right relationship with God. (15)
\bttq What was it that the disciples saw and heard that other people before them had longed to see and hear?
\tqe Other people, who had lived before them, had longed to see the Messiah and to hear more about how God would rule over people after he/the Messiah came. (16-17)

\dh Details
\bttq By what he said in verse 18, what did Jesus want the disciples to do?
\tqe He wanted the disciples to listen so that they would understand what the parable about the sower meant. (18)
\bttq What does the seed which fell on the pathway represent?
\tqe It represents the people who hear the message about the kingdom, but do not understand it. (19)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by "the evil one"?
\tqe The evil one refers to Satan. (19)
\bttq How do you think rock in the soil would cause seed not to grow well?
\tqe Some of the soil had patches where only a bit of soil covered rock underneath. The roots of the new seedlings could go down only to the rock and could not draw enough moisture to stay alive. (20)
\bttq To what sort of people did Jesus say this part of his parable was to be applied?
\tqe The seed on rocky soil represents people who hear God's truth and enjoy it, but they discontinue/quit following God just a short time later. (20-21)
\bttq What causes them to stop following God?
\tqe Any difficulties related to their following God, including their being persecuted by others will cause them to stop following him. (21)
\bttq What did Jesus say about the people who are represented in the parable by the seed that fell among the thorny weeds?
\tqe The seed which fell among the thorny weeds represents people who hear God's message and accept it. However, they become so concerned about this life and about having money that the message can not have any good influence on them. (22)
\bttq What happened to the seed that fell on good soil?
\tqe It grew up and produced thirty, sixty or even one hundred times more than what was sown. (23)
\bttq What do you think people, who read this, will understand about the thirty, sixty and one hundred fold increase to mean?
\tqe This increase means that the message did what was expected of it. That is, the message was received by a person who took it seriously. That person not only started, but also continued to serve God as expected. (23)

\rf Matthew 13:24-30 Jesus told the parable about weeds.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 13.24-30
\bttq What plan of action did the farmer take when he realized there were weeds mixed with the wheat in his field?
\tqe He told his workers to allow the weeds to grow there until harvest time when his harvesters could easily tell the difference between the weeds and the wheat (because of the seed heads being quite different). They could then gather the weeds to burn them; and they would store the wheat in his storehouse. (30)
\dh Details
\bttq To whom was Jesus referring when he talked about a man who sowed good seed, planned how to care for it and then would have his servants harvest the wheat?
\tqe Jesus was talking about God, who is the owner of the field and he is the one who will be in charge of/supervising the "harvest". (24)
\tqe He was talking about people who truly belong to God as his "harvest". (24-30)
\bttq What is the kingdom of heaven like?
\tqe It is like the story of a man who sowed good seed. (24)
\bttq Do you think that the weeds started to grow about the same time as the wheat?
\tqe Both started to grow about the same time, (but the servants did not realize it until the seed heads formed). (26)
\bttq How had the weed seeds come into the garden?
\tqe An enemy of the owner had secretly planted them there. (26-28)
\bttq What was the owner's plan to separate/for separating the weeds from the real wheat?

\tqe Those who believed Jesus were a small group now. Many would believe Jesus in the future. (31-33)
\bttq What did Matthew say about Jesus in verses 34-35?
\tqe Matthew made/makes it clear that it was to be expected that Jesus would teach in parables, since that had been predicted in the Old Testament. Then the fact that he spoke in parables was a proof of his being the Messiah. (34-35)
\dh Details
\bttq What do you think might be the reason that Jesus mentioned the birds resting in or nesting in the branches of the mustard plant?
\tqe It showed that the plant was large. Therefore, God will rule over many people.
\tqe Also it may or may not indicate that Jesus meant that religious sects, or others like them, would try to take advantage of the great size and influence of God's kingdom on earth. (32)
\bttq How much bread do you think the flour, that the woman used, might make?
\tqe There would have been about 55 lbs or 25 kilos of flour. So she could have made many loaves of bread. The main point to understand is that it was a huge batch of bread which shows the potential/capability of yeast to increase the volume of the batch. Therefore, the kingdom of God will spread and have great influence. (33)
\bttq Was it right for Jesus to teach in parables?
\tqe Yes, it had been predicted in the Old Testament that the Messiah would speak in parables. (34-35)

\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus said that people who have ears need to listen?

(Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)

\tqe The Holy Spirit was/seven spirits were before his throne. (4)
\bttq What do you think he meant by "spirit" in this verse?
\tqe Key Term Check: The seven spirits are generally understood as a way of talking about the Holy Spirit. The imagery seems to be derived from Zechariah 4. Some commentators think they refer to the seven chief angels or archangels, who are known also from Jewish tradition. But the fact that the seven spirits are grouped with the eternal God and Jesus Christ suggests that the Holy Spirit is meant, not angelic beings.

\bttq What do you think a priest does?
\tqe Key Term Check: The particular part of meaning in focus in this verse seems to be the idea of entering into God's presence, becoming his servants and offering "spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ". Another intermediary apart from Jesus Christ is not needed; the believer can enter into God's presence directly through him. (See "priest" in KBT.)
\bttq What should all believers do because of all that Jesus has done for them?

\bttq What then are the two purposes of God's law?
\tqe 1. To show us what things are wrong.
\tqe 2. To show us that, if we follow the law, we will live forever with God.
\bttq Why then does Paul say that in fact the law shows him that it is right that God remove him from his presence forever?
\tqe Because he sees that it is impossible for him to follow all the law, therefore he is a sinner. Therefore, God will condemn him.

\tqe He will raise them from death to life again, as he raised Christ from death.

\tqref 1CO 6.16
\bttq In the verse quoted from God's word book, (Genesis 2:24), who is it that become united?
\tqe Husband and wife.
\bttq What is Paul teaching?
\tqe Sexual intercourse makes a marriage because in this way man and woman become united. So if a man has intercourse with a prostitute, it is as if he has married her.
\bttq Discuss: What does this teach us concerning a man having intercourse with his girl friend or his promised wife before he has taken her to his house?
\tqe Suggested answers: He should refrain from intercourse till he has brought her to his house and married her. Or if he has had intercourse with her he should by all means marry her.
\an NB. If these teachings cannot be understood from the verses as translated, suggest alterations.

\tqe Yes, but they are sins against other people.
\tqref 1CO 6.19
\bttq Give two reasons why it is wrong to use our bodies for sexual sins.
\tqe 1. Our bodies belong to God not to ourselves alone.
\tqe 2. The Holy Spirit lives in our bodies.
\bttq Give another illustration, using a building, to explain Paul's teaching.
\tqe Just as it would be wrong to use a church as a brothel, so it would be wrong to use our bodies to sleep with a prostitute.

\bttq What does this "golden rule" say?
\tqe Use your bodies in such a way that people will see how you live and will praise God.

\rf 1 Corinthians 7:1-16 Concerning marriage.
\tqref 1CO 7.1-16
\tqref 1CO 7.1
\bttq Why does Paul say that if a man does not marry he does well?
\tqe Paul was unmarried. He believed that the end of the world was coming soon, so that people should pay attention to that and not to marrying. (See verse 26.)
\bttq Does he say that marriage is wrong?
\tqe Not at all.
\tqref 1CO 7.2
\bttq What reason does he give that it is good for men and women to marry?
\tqe So that they will not be tempted to commit adultery and rape.
\tqref 1CO 7.3-4
\bttq Why does Paul give this command?
\tqe 1. The same reason as in 7:2, that is, to prevent the other from committing adultery with another person.
\tqe 2. Because the husband and his wife belong to each other, that is, they have the right to ask the other for sexual intercourse.
\an NB. Is this well understood?
\tqref 1CO 7.5
\bttq What exception does Paul give to this rule?
\tqe 1. First they should agree together not to sleep together.
\tqe 2. It should be for a short time.
\tqe 3. It should be for the purpose of having time for more prayer.
\tqe 4. Then they should come to sleep together again.
\bttq Why should it be for a short time alone?
\tqe If not so the Devil will tempt them to love another woman/man.
\bttq Does Paul speak of a man's wife or wives?
\tqe He speaks of a man having only one wife.
\tqref 1CO 7.6
\bttq These things are not a law but are permission/are good advice. Which things?
\tqe 1. Verse 5 - The refraining from sexual intercourse for a little time. OR
\tqe 2. That every one should marry. This is the preferred interpretation.
\tqref 1CO 7.7
\bttq Why is it only permission/good advice?
\tqe Because some can refrain from marriage and be happy, but others cannot be happy until they marry. Each one has his gift from God which is different from his fellow man's.
\tqref 1CO 7.8
\bttq Whom does Paul advise not to marry if they are able to refrain from marriage?
\tqe Unmarried men and widows.
\tqref 1CO 7.9
\bttq What is marriage to prevent from happening?
\tqe It is not good that a man remains single, but be always wanting a wife. Or for a woman (widow) to remain single, and always be wanting a husband.
\tqref 1CO 7.10-11
\bttq What is Paul teaching?
\tqe It is wrong for a man to divorce his wife or for a wife to divorce her husband. But if they do separate neither husband or wife should marry another person. They should try to be reconciled.
\bttq What kind of law is this?
\tqe It definitely comes from our Master Jesus Christ.
\tqref 1CO 7.12
\bttq Does Paul encourage a Christian to marry a non-Christian?
\tqe No. (See 2 Corinthians 6:14.)
\bttq What then is he saying?
\tqe That if, for example, the husband becomes a Christian, but his wife does not, this is not a reason for him to divorce her.
\bttq How then should he act? What should he do?
\tqe If the wife is willing to stay with him, he should not divorce her.
\tqref 1CO 7.13
\bttq What does this verse say?
\tqe The same as 7:12, but in the case where the woman is a Christian and her husband is not.
\tqref 1CO 7.14
\bttq What is the reason for all this?
\tqe 1. A Christian makes his/her non-Christian wife/husband no longer to be unclean in the sight of God.
\tqe 2. This is also the same for their children.
\bttq Does that mean that the non-Christian wife/husband has become a Christian or will go to heaven?
\tqe No. He has to make his own decision. (See verse 16.)
\bttq Is the child of a person who is a Christian also a Christian?
\tqe No. He has to make his own decision.
\tqref 1CO 7.15
\bttq What is Paul teaching here?
\tqe If the non-Christian wife/husband wants to leave her husband/his wife, let him do so, and do not force him/her to return.
\bttq Why so?
\tqe Because God wants us to live at peace with one another.
\bttq Does this give permission to divorce and remarriage?
\tqe Some commentators say that this is so. Others say it is not so. The main thing is to avoid fighting.
\tqref 1CO 7.16
\bttq Why does he think that a Christian wife might save her husband (and a husband save his wife)?
\tqe Because this should be one of the reasons that a Christian will remain with her non-Christian husband (wife).
\bttq What does Paul mean by "saving"?
\tqe That God will save the husband/wife because of the way that wife/husband lives and speaks.

\tqref 1CO 7.17-24
\tqref 1CO 7.17-24
\bttq What is it that Paul says that we should not change?
\tqe The way we are living at present - married, unmarried, circumcised, uncircumcised, slave or freeman.
\bttq Why?
\tqe Probably the answer is in verse 15 - let us live in peace, and verse 29 - the time is short, Christ will return soon and verse 19. Our way of life is of less importance than keeping God's commands.
\bttq Do we change our sinful way of life?
\tqe Yes.
\bttq What is more important than the "status" that we have, that is, married, unmarried, slave or freeman?
\tqe Following God's commands.
\tqref 1CO 7.21-23

\tqref 1CO 7.22
\bttq How has the coming of Christ changed slavery?
\tqe Both master and slave now belong to Christ, who is over both master and slave.

\tqe Some say: the time when Christ will come again, others say: the troubles that Christ said would come upon all people before Christ returns.
\tqref 1CO 7.30-31
\bttq Why does Paul give this advice in these verses?
\tqe Because of how the world is now changing.
\bttq Should we not care for our wives and children anymore? Should we refuse to perform funerals anymore?
\tqe No, Paul wants us to live our lives so that the Kingdom of God is more important than the things of this world.
\tqref 1CO 7.32-35
\bttq Can an unmarried man/woman please God?
\tqe Yes, but since he/she is also trying to please his wife/her husband, he/she does not have all his/her time to go to God. He/she cannot do both well.
\bttq Why does Paul give this advice?
\tqe It is for their own good, that they might do what is right and worship our Master with all their hearts.
\tqref 1CO 7.36
\bttq When is it good to marry?
\tqe When the girl who is promised in marriage is already of marriageable age, and the man is unable to control himself.

\tqref 1CO 7.38
\bttq In Paul's opinion is it better to marry or not to marry?

\tqref 1CO 8.1-3
\bttq What do you think was the question that the Corinthians had asked Paul and he is now answering?
\tqe Should we eat food or animals killed for fetishes?
\bttq Why does he speak about knowledge and being wise? What did the Corinthians say in addition to their question?
\tqe Fetishes are nothing, therefore, they said, they can eat food/meat offered to them.
\bttq How does Paul answer their "wisdom"?
\tqe If a person is clever, or has knowledge, he will become proud.
\bttq How should he use his knowledge?
\tqe He should use it to strengthen his fellow Christians in their faith.
\bttq What is the best kind of knowledge that a man should want?
\tqe To know and love God so that God will know him, that is, God will accept him as his own person.
\tqref 1CO 8.4-5
\bttq What does this teach us about fetishes?
\tqe 1. They have no power in this world.
\tqe 2. There are many fetishes, some say some are on the earth and some in heaven.
\tqe 3. Some people call them master and worship them as if they are God.
\tqref 1CO 8.6
\bttq What do we learn about God from this verse?
\tqe 1. He alone exists - there is no other.
\tqe 2. He created us.
\an NB. Is it absolutely clear that Paul is saying that fetishes do not exist, except that people believe that they exist?
\bttq Whom are we permitted to call our Master?
\tqe God and Jesus Christ.
\bttq What shows that Jesus Christ is equal to God?
\tqe Because through Christ, God created the world and gave us life.
\tqref 1CO 8.7
\bttq What kind of people are those whose consciences are weak, that is, their hearts are troubled concerning eating food that has been offered to fetishes?
\tqe They are those who have recently become Christians and they still believe that fetishes exist and have power.
\bttq What, for such people, is the result of eating fetish food?
\tqe Their hearts become dirty.
\tqref 1CO 8.8-11
\bttq What foods does Paul taboo eating?
\tqe None.
\bttq How can we please God in what we eat?
\tqe It does nothing for us in God's sight to eat or to taboo any food.
\bttq Why then does Paul taboo the eating of food that has been offered to fetishes?
\tqe Because if we eat it, and one who has a weak conscience, that is, he believes that fetishes exist and have power see us, and also eats, he will fall into sin and go back to worshipping fetishes and stop believing in Christ, and God will send him away from his presence forever.
\tqref 1CO 8.12

\tqref 1CO 9.1-27
\tqref 1CO 9.1
\bttq Why does Paul have to say that he is free?
\tqe Because in 8:13 he puts himself under a law, which is not really a law, for the sake of others. But he is free to live how God tells him.
\bttq What shows that he is free?
\tqe He is an apostle of Jesus.
\bttq What shows that he is truly an apostle of Jesus?
\tqe 1. He has seen Jesus with his own eyes.
\tqe 2. They, the Corinthians, came to believe in Jesus because of Paul's work for Jesus.
\tqref 1CO 9.2
\bttq Who of all people should not say that Paul is not an apostle?

\bttq What two rights does Paul claim for himself and all apostles?
\tqe 1. To get food and drink for the work he does.
\tqe 2. To be accompanied on his journeys by a Christian wife.

\tqe 1. A soldier does not serve at his own expense, paying for his own food.
\tqe 2. A farmer eats food from his own farm.
\tqe 3. The owner of a cow drinks the cow's milk.
\tqe 4. A cow that treads (guinea) corn to thresh it for the farmer is allowed to eat some of it.

\tqref 1CO 9.12
\bttq Did Paul and his fellow teachers claim food and drink from the Corinthians while he was in their town?
\tqe No.
\bttq Why not?
\tqe So that nothing would prevent the preaching of Christ's good news from going forward.
\bttq Why would accepting food and drink hinder God's work?
\tqe Because some would falsely accuse Paul of preaching only to get money.

\tqe Priests/Sacrifice offerers eat some of the meat that people offer to God.
\tqref 1CO 9.15
\bttq Is Paul wanting something from them for his preaching to them?

\tqref 1CO 9.16-17
\bttq Do you understand why Paul cannot boast about the fact that he preached to them, but he can boast that when he preached, he did not collect money from them?
\tqe If it had been true that he chose of his own will to preach, then he could rightly claim payment. But as it was God who forced him to become a preacher, like a master makes a slave work for him, he cannot claim a reward, he is only doing his duty. If he fails to preach, God will punish him.
\tqref 1CO 9.18
\bttq Will Paul get any reward at all?

\bttq What other right does Paul refuse to use?

\tqe To make as many as possible become Christians.
\tqref 1CO 9.20-22
\bttq In what way did Paul become a slave to everyone?

\tqref 1CO 9.21
\bttq Why would some accuse Paul of being against God's law?
\tqe Because the Jews received their laws from God.

\tqref 1CO 9.22
\bttq How did Paul help those whose faith in Christ was weak?

\bttq In what way can we become like those whose faith is weak in order to help them?
\tqe For example, if we want to help someone who believes that it is wrong to eat certain foods, then for his sake we will not eat such foods, though there is no law of God that forbids us to eat such foods. (See 1 Corinthians 8:9-13.)

\tqe No, what they do not know, but which is true, is that the fetishes are really the Devil and it is the Devil that fetish worshippers are worshipping.

\tqe That she is performing funeral. But if they shave her head, (and it is not for a funeral) then it is for a punishment. Whichever reason it is, a woman whose head is shaved should cover her head.
\bttq If a woman refuses to cover her head when prophesying or praying, what is she doing?
\tqe She is refusing to accept the authority of man over her and so she deserves to have her hair shaved off as a punishment.
\bttq Discuss: Is Paul making a rule for all time or is what he says a custom which is different from time to time and from tribe to tribe?
\tqref 1CO 11.7
\bttq Why did God create man first and woman second?
\tqe So that through man, God's greatness might be seen and through woman, man's greatness might be seen.
\bttq Does this mean that in woman is not seen the greatness of God?
\tqe It seems to mean that man is first among equals, for whatever greatness man gets from God, it is shared with his wife.
\tqref 1CO 11.8-9
\bttq In what way did God use man to create woman?
\tqe According to Genesis 2:21-23, God took a bone from man's body and used it to make a woman.
\bttq Why did God make a woman?
\tqe To help man and to be his wife.
\tqref 1CO 11.10
\bttq In summary what does Paul say is the reason a woman should cover her head?
\tqe To show that she is under her husband's authority and that she honors God's angels.

\bttq Can men live without women or women live without men?
\tqe If they do for long, the human race will become extinct.

\tqref 1CO 11.17-19
\bttq What does Paul say that the Corinthian Christians are doing wrong?
\tqe When they go to church, they divide up into many groups.
\bttq Why is this not good?
\tqe It shows that Christians are not united.
\bttq Is it always wrong to have arguments among Christians?
\tqe No. If some people are wrong and some are right, then a discussion/argument will reveal who is right and who is wrong.
\tqref 1CO 11.20-21
\bttq What was wrong with the way they were eating our Master's supper?
\tqe Each brought food and ate it alone by himself; some even got drunk, while others on the other hand sat and had nothing to eat. That is, those who had brought food did not share it.
\tqref 1CO 11.22
\bttq What does their behavior show about their thoughts?
\tqe They had no respect for their fellow church members, especially those who were poor and had little food, and so they were not respecting the church.

\tqe Our Master's supper is not a full meal, but a small meal to remember Christ's death.
\tqref 1CO 11.23-24
\bttq Is what happened at the first Master's supper just the opinion of Paul?
\tqe No, it is a teaching that has come from Christ himself.
\bttq What two things does the bread of our Master's supper show?
\tqe 1. It represents Christ's body. When Christ died he died for us. So the bread is for us.
\tqe 2. It reminds us always of Christ.
\tqref 1CO 11.25
\bttq Is the drinking of the wine part of our Master's supper?
\tqe Yes. It follows the eating of the bread.
\bttq What two things does the wine of our Master's supper show?
\tqe 1. It represents his blood which sealed the new covenant/oath.
\tqe 2. It reminds us always of Christ.

\bttq How often should Christians eat our Master's supper?
\tqe It does not say.
\bttq Until when should Christians continue to eat our Master's supper?
\tqe Until his second coming.
\bttq In short what is the meaning of the bread and the wine?
\tqe Christians are again telling one another of the reason why Christ died.
\tqref 1CO 11.27
\bttq If we show disrespect to our Master's supper what does that show?
\tqe That we disrespect Christ's body and blood, that is, we have no respect for the reason for his death.
\tqref 1CO 11.28
\bttq How can we avoid disrespect to our Master's supper?
\tqe By looking into our hearts before we come to eat and drink.
\tqref 1CO 11.29
\bttq In short what should we remember if we are to avoid God judging us guilty of disrespect?
\tqe The bread stands for Christ's body.
\tqe The wine stands for Christ's blood.
\tqe They both stand for his death for us.
\tqref 1CO 11.30
\bttq Why have some Corinthian Christians become weak and sick and some have died?
\tqe God has judged them guilty of disrespect to our Master's supper and has punished them.
\tqref 1CO 11.31-32
\bttq In what way is God merciful in his disciplining of Christians?
\tqe He disciplines us now in order to save us from being judged and punished in the same way that he will punish the bad people of this world.
\tqref 1CO 11.33-34
\bttq What two simple rules will help them to have respect for our Master's supper?
\tqe 1. Wait till all have arrived - wait for one another to arrive.

\bttq If someone says, "Jesus is my Master", who or what caused him to say it?
\tqe God's Holy Spirit.

\tqe We all belong to one family.
\tqref 1CO 12.14-16
\bttq What does this proverb teach in respect of the church?
\tqe No one member of the whole church of Christ can say that he is not a member just because he does not have the same gift as a fellow member.
\tqref 1CO 12.17
\bttq What also does this proverb teach in respect of the church?
\tqe There would be something wrong with the church if everyone was a pastor, or everyone was a prophet, because all the gifts are needed for a strong church.
\tqref 1CO 12.18-20

\tqe None of us, as members of the church, can do without the other members and their gifts. They are someone to us. The smaller need the greater.

\tqe Sexual parts.
\bttq Can we live without them?
\tqe No.
\tqref 1CO 12.24

\tqref 1CO 12.25-26
\bttq What more teaching does Paul want to show in this proverb?

\bttq What shows that we have love for our fellow man?
\tqe We are patient with him, we are kind, we are not jealous, we don't boast, we are not proud and we don't insult others. We don't force others to do what we want, we don't get angry and we don't seek revenge. We are not happy when someone does wrong, we are happy when someone does good.

\bttq What will cease before love?
\tqe The power to prophesy, the power to speak in other languages, wisdom (and other gifts).

\tqe 2. Towards the end of the world these gifts will cease before men cease to love.

\bttq Why will we understand everything?

\tqe Because Jesus is God and will rule a kingdom in which there is no more bad.
\tqref 1CO 13.11
\bttq What does Paul use the proverb to show?
\tqe Our present life is like that of a child, who knows only childhood things and whose wisdom is small. In our life when Jesus comes again we will know all things.

\bttq What two other proverbs does Paul use to describe this life of ours on earth?

\bttq When Jesus returns, how will our knowledge be?
\tqe Like that of God and how God knows us very well now.

\bttq What will pass leaving only faith, hope and love?

\bttq In verse 8 Paul says that only love will continue, but now he says that also faith and hope will continue. How is this so?
\tqe If we love our fellow man we will also trust him and hope in him. If we love God we will also trust him and hope in him. (Also see verse 7.)
\bttq In what way is love greater than faith and hope?
\tqe 1. When we see (God and) Jesus face to face we will continue to love him, but we do not any more need to trust and hope in one whom we now see face to face.
\tqe 2. Our faith saves ourselves. Our love saves others.
\bttq Can we just love God and our fellow man and leave off trusting and hoping?
\tqe No, because our trust in Jesus makes us love him and hope for his coming. Our love for our fellow man makes us trust him and hope for him to do what is good.
\bttq Are faith, hope and love gifts from God in the same way as prophecy, wisdom, etc.?
\tqe 1. They are greater/more useful gifts. (See 12:31.)
\tqe 2. They are gifts, without which we cannot be Christians.
\tqe 3. Therefore everyone should ask God for them.
\tqe 4. As for the other gifts we can ask God, and if he agrees he will give them to us.
\tqe 5. But these other gifts do not make God think we are better people because we have gifts.

\tqe Love is something we should all get in our hearts. But prophecy is the most important of all God's other gifts.
\bttq Why is prophecy very important?
\tqe It is God speaking directly through a person, revealing his thoughts to human beings.
\tqref 1CO 14.2
\bttq Why is prophecy more important than speaking in another language?
\tqe 1. Other people can understand prophecy since it is spoken in our language.
\tqe 2. If someone speaks in another language, neither he nor other people understand him.
\bttq If that is so, what use is speaking in another language?
\tqe He is speaking to God and praising him, but only God understands what he is saying.
\tqref 1CO 14.3
\bttq What good does prophecy do?
\tqe It helps other Christians, it strengthens their faith and it gives them comfort.

\bttq In short why is prophecy more useful than speaking in another language?
\tqe It helps others, but another language helps only the one who speaks.
\tqref 1CO 14.5
\bttq So does Paul say that it is not good to speak in another language?
\tqe He wishes all to have the gifts of prophecy and speaking in another language.
\bttq Under what circumstances can speaking in another language be as useful as prophesying?
\tqe When the speaker can also interpret the language into the language of his fellow church members.
\tqref 1CO 14.6
\bttq What does this add to the previous verses?
\tqe That Paul himself did not speak to the Corinthians in a language that he did not understand.

\tqe We must speak a language that our fellow men will understand, if not so they will not mind us.

\bttq What is the thing that really separates one people from another?
\tqe That they each speak a different language.

\tqe So as to help our fellow church members.
\tqref 1CO 14.13
\bttq What gift is better than speaking in other languages?
\tqe The power to interpret other languages.
\tqref 1CO 14.14-16
\bttq Why is speaking in other languages that we don't hear not helpful?
\tqe 1. The speaker does not understand his own words.
\tqe 2. The hearers do not understand him and so they cannot agree or disagree with him.
\bttq How should we worship God in prayer and song?
\tqe With heart and mind, that is, with sincerity and understanding.
\tqref 1CO 14.17-19
\bttq In what language should we pray and speak in church?

\tqe When we pray alone to God.
\tqref 1CO 14.20
\bttq In what ways does Paul say it is wrong to be childish and right to be childish?
\tqe They should think like adults in respect of the gifts of speaking; but like children they should be free of bad thoughts and deeds.
\tqref 1CO 14.22
\bttq Looking at verses 21 and 22, say how speaking in foreign languages is a warning to those who don't believe.
\tqe If people refuse to believe God's words when he speaks to them in their own language, he sends people speaking foreign languages. This warns them that God is not happy with them. A sign without an interpretation is a worry to people.
\tqref 1CO 14.23-25
\bttq Show how verse 22 does not contradict 23-24.
\tqe When God sends people speaking in foreign languages to us it is God warning us. If we speak in a language that is the gift of the Holy Spirit it does not help our fellow believers, and it seems like madness to those who do not belong to our church. But if we speak in our own language what God reveals to us (prophesy) and a non-member comes in and hears us, maybe that person will hear God speaking to him and will repent of his sins and believe that God is truly among us.
\tqref 1CO 14.26-28
\bttq In summary how does Paul recommend that they should conduct their church services?
\tqe Freely, but in an orderly way; everyone taking part as God leads him, but one after the other and in order; in a way which will help one another and make their faith increase.
\bttq What kind of things are good for a church worship service?
\tqe Songs, teaching, prophesy (what God reveals to someone) and speaking in a language that the speaker does not understand if someone can interpret it.
\tqref 1CO 14.29-30
\bttq What does Paul say about prophesying?

\bttq What is the reason for people being allowed to prophesy in church?
\tqe To teach and encourage fellow church members.
\tqref 1CO 14.32-33
\bttq How do you understand these verses?
\tqe 1. A prophet has control over the words that he speaks. He can wait till the time is right for him to rise and speak.
\tqe 2. God does not want noisy, disorderly church meetings.
\tqref 1CO 14.34-35
\bttq Give two reasons why women should keep quiet in church meetings.
\tqe 1. So that the meetings do not become disorderly.
\tqe 2. Because women are under men's authority.
\bttq If a woman has a question to ask, how will she get an answer?
\tqe By asking her husband at home, that is, if he is a Christian and has been with her at church.
\bttq Discuss: Is Paul making a rule for all times and all peoples or is he only repeating what was the Jewish and Christian custom of his time?
\tqref 1CO 14.36
\bttq Why does Paul ask these (rhetorical) questions? What is he saying?
\tqe They in Corinth have no right to change the customs that have been accepted in the other churches, especially since they were not the first Christians.

\bttq How does Paul summarize this chapter?

\tqe 2. Prophecy is a gift to be desired more than others.
\tqe 3. Speaking in a language that a person doesn't understand is not forbidden (but see v.28 there must be an interpreter).

\tqe 2. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from death.
\bttq Why is this good news not an invention by Paul?

\tqref 1CO 15.8-9
\bttq Why does Paul liken himself to a child who is born late?
\tqe Because he was the last of the apostles to see the resurrected Christ.
\bttq Why was Paul not worthy to be an apostle?
\tqe Because before he saw Christ on the road to Damascus, he persecuted God's church people.
\tqref 1CO 15.10
\bttq Why did he become an apostle?
\tqe Because God had mercy on him and made him become what he is now.
\bttq Is Paul boasting?
\tqe He says he has worked harder than all the other apostles, but it is with God's strength that he has done this. He became an apostle, not because he was good, but because God had mercy on him.
\tqref 1CO 15.11
\bttq What difference is there between Paul's preaching of the good news and the other apostles' preaching?
\tqe None. It is the same message preached by them all and the same message that all the Corinthians have believed.
\tqref 1CO 15.12
\bttq Some Corinthians said that people who have died will not rise to life again. Why is this teaching wrong?
\tqe Because all the apostles have taught that Christ himself was raised from death.
\tqref 1CO 15.13
\bttq How is our belief that we will rise again connected to our belief that Christ rose again?
\tqe If one is false, both are false. If one is true, both are true.
\tqref 1CO 15.14
\bttq If it is not true that God raised Christ from death what does that show?
\tqe 1. That the preaching of the good news is for nothing and is a lie.
\tqe 2. That the Corinthians believing the good news is for nothing.
\tqref 1CO 15.16-17
\bttq What does Paul say in addition to verses 13-15?
\tqe He repeats his thoughts and adds that our being free from sins is because Christ rose from death. If he did not rise then what we believe is a lie and our sins remain on us.
\tqref 1CO 15.18
\bttq If our faith is a lie, what of those who were Christians and have died?
\tqe It means that they too have no hope of rising from death.

\bttq What thing if it was removed from our belief would make our case worse than that of all other people?
\tqe Our hope to rise from death and live with Christ in heaven.
\bttq Is there any difference between "hope in Christ" and "belief in Christ" in these verses?
\tqe Hope means belief that we will get something in the future.
\tqref 1CO 15.20
\bttq In what way is Christ a leader in his death? What does his death guarantee?
\tqe He is the first to rise from death and not die a second time. His rising again shows that those who believed in him and died will rise to life again like him.
\tqref 1CO 15.21-22
\bttq Contrast Adam with Christ.
\tqe Because Adam sinned, death came into the world. Because of Christ's death and resurrection, all who follow Christ will rise from death.
\tqref 1CO 15.23
\bttq In what order will the resurrection happen?
\tqe Christ has already risen and gone to heaven. When he returns, God will raise all Christians to life.

\bttq In what order will the end of the world come?
\tqe Christ will come again as King of the world. He will raise his people to life, he will collect all power from men and he and God will fight and defeat all his enemies. Then he will hand the Kingdom of the world back to God.

\bttq What false teaching can be understood here?
\tqe That Christ was not born but came straight from heaven to earth.
\bttq What is the true teaching about Christ's coming to earth?

\tqref 1CO 15.48-49

\tqref 1CO 15.58
\bttq Since this is so, can we relax and know that we need do nothing except believe in Christ?
\tqe Our belief that certainly we will go to heaven and also rise from death at the end of the world should make our faith stronger and make us work even harder for our Master Jesus Christ.
\bttq What further comfort do we have in our work for him?
\tqe There is nothing that we do for him which is for nothing.

\tqe The apostle John wanted the Christians and the apostles, including himself, to have complete joy. (4)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to have fellowship with someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means to have companionship. The word "fellowship" refers to a relationship between two or more people all of whom have something in common or all of whom/who participate in the same activity. The same Greek word may also be translated in certain contexts as "sharing", "participation", or "partnership". (See "fellowship" in KBT.)
\dh Details
\bttq If your translation has "word of life," to whom does this refer?

\rf 1 John 1:5-10 God is light and there is no darkness in him at all. John told the Christians that, if they live in the light where God is, they will have fellowship with him and he will have fellowship with them.
\oh Overview
\tqref 1JN 1.5-10
\bttq Tell in your own words the basic meaning (theme) of what John said in these verses.
\tqe John said that God is light, there is no darkness in him at all. (5)
\tqe If anyone wants to have fellowship with God he must walk in the light. (6-7)
\bttq Who do you think God is?
\tqe Key Term Check: In English, the term "God" with a capital "g" is used to refer to the one supreme Creator. The term "god" with a small "g", as in "a god" or "many gods", can refer to any spiritual being that people worship. The Greek word theos can be used in the same two ways.
\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralised. (Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)
\bttq In your language, do you use the word "light" as a figure? If you use the figure, what does it mean?
\an (Note: Some languages have a problem in translating the word for light in a figurative sense.)

\tqe Key Term Check: Light refers to truth or divine truth.
\an -OR-
\an Light refers to knowledge of God or revelation about him.
\bttq What do you think "darkness" means in this verse?
\tqe Key Term Check: Darkness refers to spiritual or moral sin/all that is evil.
\dh Details
\bttq Where did John get this message?
\tqe He heard it from him [Jesus Christ]. (5)
\bttq If we say we have fellowship with God, but at the same time, we walk in the darkness/do evil deeds, what are we saying?
\tqe We are lying and
\tqe we are not putting the truth into practice/not living by the truth. (6)
\bttq If we walk in the light/do not do evil deeds, we will have fellowship with God. With whom else will we have fellowship?
\tqe We will have fellowship with other believers. (7)
\bttq How does God forgive our sins?
\tqe He forgives us because Christ died for us. (7)
\bttq What does a person do when he sins?
\tqe Key Term Check: He disobeys God. He deliberately keeps on doing those things that please himself and displease God. (See "sin" in KBT.)
\bttq If we say that we have not sinned, what are we doing?
\tqe We are deceiving/fooling ourselves, and we are not telling the truth. (8)
\bttq What are we to do when/if we have sinned?
\tqe We are to confess/admit/acknowledge our sins to God. (9)
\bttq Then what will God do?
\tqe God will forgive us of our sins, and
\tqe he will forgive our sins. (9)
\bttq What do you think happens when someone forgives someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: Forgiveness always involves two people, one of whom has done something wrong to the other and offended him. Forgiveness takes place when the one who was offended sets aside his right to justice and decides not to punish the offender as he deserved. If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, then the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offence, is restored, and the guilt of the offender is removed. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\bttq How do we know that God will really do that?
\tqe We know that he will because God does what he says he will do, and because God does everything correctly. (9)
\bttq What do you think it means when someone is faithful?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that someone will do what he says he will do. A person is worthy of being believed by someone else. They are trustworthy, reliable. (See "faithful" in KBT in the "believe" entry.)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to deal with someone else justly?
\tqe Key Term Check: He does only what is right to do. Doing something in conformity with law or justice. It refers to God's faithful and consistent adherence to his covenant. (See "just" in KBT.)
\bttq If we say that we have not sinned, what do we think about God?
\tqe We think that God is a liar, because God has said that all people have sinned. (10)
\bttq What is meant by "his word has no place in our lives"?
\tqe It means that we have not believed his word nor allowed it to change our lives. (10)

\tqe Key Term Check: It is all the people who live on the earth. (See "world" in KBT.)
\bttq What does it mean to you that Jesus became the atoning sacrifice for everyone?
\tqe Key Term Check: He died to take the punishment for our sins. The penalty for sin was death, but "God graciously permitted the death of a sacrificial victim to substitute for the death of the sinner". The sin of the person having been transferred to the victim, atonement was made, that is, fellowship between the person and God was restored. Jesus is the sacrificial victim who paid the price for everyone's sins. (See "atonement" in KBT.)
\dh Details
\bttq To whom did John write this letter?
\tqe He wrote it to the Christians/his children. (1)

\tqe Jesus Christ will speak to the Father in their defense. (1)
\bttq What is the reason that the Father will listen to Jesus Christ?
\tqe He will listen to Jesus, because he is completely good. (1)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to be righteous?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that God has accepted that person as right in his eyes. In this reference it refers to the fact that Christ was in the right with God. (See "righteousness" in KBT in the "just, justify..." entry.)
\bttq How can we be sure that we really know God?
\tqe We can be sure that we know him, if we obey his commands. (3)
\bttq What is a person doing who/when he says that he knows God but does not do what he commands him to do?

\bttq How can a Christian be sure that he is in a continuing relationship with God?

\bttq What was the new meaning of that command?
\tqe It was that they were to love one another as Christ had shown how to love people by the way he lived. (8)
\bttq Why is this true?

\bttq What did John say about any person who says he is in the light, that is, he lives good as God does good; and yet hates his brother?
\tqe That person is still living in the darkness, that is, he is doing evil. (9)

\tqe Key Term Check: In this reference "brother" means fellow believer or fellow Christian. (See "brother" in KBT in the "disciple" entry.)
\bttq What did John say about a person who loves his brother?
\tqe He said that person is living in the light, that is, he lives good as God does good;

\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralised. (Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)
