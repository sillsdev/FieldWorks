	  Export to index cards in an HTML format following the configuration of the dictionary view (including the order of fields), and any current filters and sorts.
	  Although the resulting HTML file can be viewed in any web browser, Internet Explorer is recommended to print exactly 8 cards per page with the following Page Setup:
	  Page Size A4, Portrait, Headers and Footers all set to Empty, Margins all set to .25 inches (.6 cm).
	  The following Entry/Sense fields have some CSS stylesheet support: Headword, Lexeme Form, Citation Form, CV Pattern (Pronunciation), Gloss (Sense), Name/Abbr(Lists).
	  For custom fields, only Entry custom fields originally named "Plural" or "XXX Plural Form" have special stylesheet support.
	  All other field text will show without a style.
