<!-- a key term that might be used in an indexing scheme for a document.
A given indexTerm may be expressed in more than one language (e.g. English, Spanish, French, etc.).  Thus it has multiple term elements.
A given indexTerm may have other index terms nested under it.
It only shows if there is an instance of a referring index element in the document
   the id attribute uniquely identifies this index term so it can be referred to by indexedItem and IndexedRangeBegin
   the see attribute refers to another term, allowing an entry in the index that refers the reader to the "real" data
   the kind attribute indicates the kind of index it will be in (if the user decides to have multiple indexes)
