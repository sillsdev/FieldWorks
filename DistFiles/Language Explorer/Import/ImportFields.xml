		</Examples>

		<Limitations>
		  <Limitation>The import process currently does not handle allomorph
		  environments. It simply imports the entire field content as a single
		  allomorph. If your field contains environment information as in the
		  last example, you'll either need to remove them prior to import,
		  manually fix them inside of Flex after import, or use an advanced
		  process to manipulate the final XML file prior to
		  import.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>Flex currently does not interpret multiple allomorphs in
		  a single SFM field. You will either need to split these into
		  individual \a fields prior to import, or clean up the problem inside
		  of Flex.</Limitation>
		</Limitations>

		<Extras>
		  <Extra>Flex uses affix marks (e.g., the hyphens in the examples) to
		  create an affix or stem allomorph and fills in the form from the
		  field contents. The Morph Type for the allomorph is also determined
		  by the affix marks. The affix marks will then be stripped from the
		  form inside of Flex.</Extra>

		  <Example>\cf house; cottage (don't include multiple lexemes in one

		<Limitations>
		  <Limitation>The format of the lexeme must be headword2 1.1 where an
		  optional homograph number is appended to the headword and an
		  optional sense number can be included after a space. This example
		  would search for the second homograph of headword and the first
		  subsense under the first sense. Note that the headword is the
		  citation form, if it exists, otherwise the lexeme form. If a sense
		  number is not specified, and the target is a sense instead of an
		  entry, the first sense in the entry will be used.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>The headword should be used in this field. If an entry
		  has a citation form, it will use this when searching for the
		  headword. Otherwise it will use the lexeme form.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>If the specified entry/sense cannot be found, an error
		  message is stored in import residue listing the
		  problem.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>Only one cross reference is allowed per field at this
		  point. If you have multiple forms separated by a separator, you
		  should break these into individual fields prior to import, or the
		  links will fail to match the desired entries.</Limitation>
		</Limitations>

		<Extras>
		  <Extra>The Lexical Reference Type combobox allows you to select an
		  existing cross reference type. If you want, you can type in a name
		  for a new lexical reference type. If a new lexical reference type is
		  created, the name and abbreviation will both be set to the field
		  contents and it will be set to a pair mapping type with one
		  name.</Extra>

		  <Extra>A link will be set between the current entry and the entry or
		  sense specified in the field. If an existing cross reference
		  collection exists to which this can be a part, they will be merged.
		  Otherwise a new cross reference collection will be created. Thus, if
		  the current entry was sedan and it has two fields, \cf car and \cf
		  auto, all three entries could be linked to each other, depending on
		  the lexical reference type.</Extra>

		  <Extra>In Flex if you set a lexical function to one sense or entry,
		  a corresponding function will automatically be inserted in the
		  target sense or entry back to this entry.</Extra>

		<Limitations>
		  <Limitation>The format of the lexeme must be headword2 1.1 where an
		  optional homograph number is appended to the headword and an
		  optional sense number can be included after a space. This example
		  would search for the second homograph of headword and the first
		  subsense under the first sense. Note that the headword is the
		  citation form, if it exists, otherwise the lexeme form. If a sense
		  number is not specified, and the target is a sense instead of an
		  entry, the first sense in the entry will be used.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>If the specified entry/sense cannot be found, an error
		  message is stored in import residue listing the
		  problem.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>The headword should be used in this field. If an entry
		  has a citation form, it will use this when searching for the
		  headword. Otherwise it will use the lexeme form.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>Only one lexeme is allowed per field at this point. If
		  you have multiple forms separated by a separator, you should break
		  these into individual pairs of fields prior to import, or the links
		  will fail to match the desired entries.</Limitation>

		<Extras>
		  <Extra>A link will be set between the current entry or sense and the

		  reference collection exists to which this can be a part, they will
		  be merged. Otherwise a new function collection will be
		  created.</Extra>

		  <Extra>In Flex if you set a lexical function to one sense or entry,

		<Limitations>
		  <Limitation>Flex will import nested senses if this field is used
		  properly. For it to work, every sense should have a \sn field with
		  the content being a single digit for top level senses, and then use
		  legal outline numbering for subsenses (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1,
		  1.2.2, 1.3, 2, 2.1). If you start with with more than one digit
		  (e.g., 1.0) the import process will currently fail to import that
		  sense. It is not designed to handle alpha or alphanumeric sense
		  numbers (e.g., a, b, 1a, 1b, etc.). It also assumes senses are in
		  the correct order (e.g., 1, 3, 2, 3.1 will not work). This field is
		  not intended for non-European numbers.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>Flex does not store sense numbers in the database, but
		  just uses the internal ownership hierarchy to generate a sense
		  number. Thus, other than for nested senses, the contents of this
		  field are ignored.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>By default, an MDF import allows \sn or \ps to start a
		  new sense. If you don't have a \sn for each sense, \sn will not
		  necessarily force a new sense. For example, given fields \sn \ps v
		  \ps n \sn, the final \sn will not force a new sense. This happens
		  whenever you allow multiple key markers for a group of fields. A new
		  sense will only be started if the key marker is already used up in
		  the existing sense. Thus \sn \ps v will go into one sense, then \ps
		  n will start a new sense since the first sense already has a \ps
		  field. The final \sn will be part of the second sense since that
		  field is still unfilled in the second sense.</Limitation>

		<Limitations>
		  <Limitation>The format of the lexeme must be headword2 1.1 where an
		  optional homograph number is appended to the headword and an
		  optional sense number can be included after a space. This example
		  would search for the second homograph of headword and the first
		  subsense under the first sense. Note that the headword is the
		  citation form, if it exists, otherwise the lexeme form. If a sense
		  number is not specified, and the target is a sense instead of an
		  entry, the first sense in the entry will be used.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>If the specified entry/sense cannot be found, an error
		  message is stored in import residue listing the
		  problem.</Limitation>

		  <Limitation>Only one cross reference is allowed per field at this
		  point. If you have multiple forms separated by a separator, you
		  should break these into individual fields prior to import, or the
		  links will fail to match the desired entries.</Limitation>
		</Limitations>

		<Extras>
		  <Extra>The Lexical Reference Type combobox allows you to select an
		  existing cross reference type. If you want, you can type in a name
		  for a new lexical reference type. If a new lexical reference type is
		  created, the name and abbreviation will both be set to the field
		  contents and it will be set to a pair mapping type with one
		  name.</Extra>

		  <Extra>A link will be set between the current subentry and the entry
		  or sense specified in the field. If an existing cross reference
		  collection exists to which this can be a part, they will be merged.
		  Otherwise a new coss reference collection will be created. Thus, if
		  the current subentry was sedan and it has two fields, \cf car and
		  \cf auto, all three entries could be linked to each other, depending
		  on the lexical reference type.</Extra>

		  <Extra>In Flex if you set a lexical function to one sense or entry,
		  a corresponding function will automatically be inserted in the
		  target sense or entry back to this subentry.</Extra>
