# Configuration Files Folder Readme

This folder contains the **default configurations** for **Dictionary** and **ReversalIndexes** (February 2014).

It may in the future contain default configurations for the Notebook, Classified Dictionary, and possibly others.

## Configuration Details

* Cases where the user has not made any modifications to them.
