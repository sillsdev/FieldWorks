IPA Unicode 5.0c (ver 1.0.1)  MSK readme.txt
version 1.0.1

This keyboard uses The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC):
http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx

It was designed to be similar to SIL's IPA Unicode Keyman Keyboard,
in that the keystrokes follow a similar layout. In many cases keystrokes are
merely reversed. That is, instead of typing "n>" to get an eng, you would
type ">n". This system is not always possible to maintain using MSKLC
since the Keyman keyboard often used more than two keystrokes and this is
not allowed using MSKLC. Please read IPA Unicode 5.0c (ver 1.0.1)  MSK.pdf
for installation instructions and the keyboard layout.
