.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rxp
reads and parses XML from the
.I url
(or standard input if none is provided) and writes it to standard
output, optionally expanding entities, defaulting attributes, and
translating to a different output encoding.

.B rxp
accepts XML 1.0 and 1.1, and the corresponding versions of XML
namespaces.  It implements the Oasis XML catalog specification.

Common option combinations are
.B -Nxs
to check a document for well-formedness and namespace well-formedness,
and
.B -VNxs
to also check for DTD-validity.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a
Insert declared default values for omitted attributes.
.TP
.B -v
Be verbose.
.TP
.B -V
Validate the document.  Repeating this option will make the program
treat validity errors as well-formedness errors, and exit
after the first validity error (otherwise a warning will be printed for
each one).
.TP
.B -d
Read the whole DTD (internal and external parts) regardless of any
standalone declaration.  Otherwise a declaration "standalone='yes'"
will prevent the external part from being read (unless validation
is selected).
.TP
.B -N
Enable XML namespace support.  The document will be checked for
correct namespace syntax, and if \f3-b\f1 is specified  qualified
element and attribute names will be displayed with their URIs.
.TP
.B -R
The value of this flag is a time limit in seconds, after which the
program will abort.  This is to protect against denial-of-service
attacks using malicious documents.
.TP
.B -S
Keep track of xml:space attributes.  This will only affect output when
\f3-b\f1 is specified.
.TP
.B -e
Obsolete, do not use.
.TP
.B -E
Do not expand entity references (opposite of old \f3-e\f1 flag)
.TP
.B -s
Be silent (that is, suppress output).  Useful for benchmarking or if you just
want to see the error messages.
.TP
.B -b
Print output as "bits".
.TP
.B -n
Treat the input as normalised SGML rather than XML.  Not intended
for general use.
.TP
.B -o
If this flag is \f3p\f1, output is in the default (plain) format. If it
is \f3b\f1, output is printed as "bits" (equivalent to
\f3-b\f1).    If it
is \f30\f1, output is suppressed (equivalent to \f3-s\f1).  If it is
\f31\f1, \f32\f1 or \f33\f1, output is in first, second or third
canonical form.
If it is \f3i\f1, output is a dump of the document's infoset.
If it is \f3d\f1, output is in a form suitable for use with "diff";
in particular attributes are sorted into alphabetical order.
.TP
.B -m
Merge PCData across entity references.  This will only affect the output when
\f3-b\f1 is specified.
.TP
.B -t
Read in the input as a tree, rather than bits.  Should make no difference
to the output.
.TP
\f3-u \f2base_uri\f1
Use the specified base URI when resolving system identifiers.
.TP
.B -U
This flag controls Unicode normalization checking and is only relevant
when parsing XML 1.1 documents.
If it is \f30\f1, no checking is done.
If it is \f31\f1,
.B rxp
checks that the document is fully normalized as defined by the W3C character
model.
If it is \f32\f1, the document is checked and any unknown characters
(which may be ones corresponding to a newer version of Unicode than
.B rxp
knows about) will also cause an error.
.TP
.B -x
Strict XML mode.  This suppresses some warnings (eg entity redefinitions)
but treats all XML well-formedness errors as fatal.
This flag implies the \f3-a\f1 flag, and sets
the output encoding to UTF-8 unless the \f3-c\f1 flag is given.  It
sets the output format to first canonical form unless the \f3-o\f1,
\f3-b\f1 or \f3-s\f1 flag is given.
.TP
\f3-c \f2encoding\f1
Produce output in the specified character encoding.  Known encodings
include \f3ISO-8859-1\f1, \f3UTF-8\f1, \f3ISO-10646-UCS\f1 and \f3UTF-16\f1.
16-bit encoding names my be suffixed with \f3-B\f1 or \f3-L\f1 to
specify big- or little-endian byte order (the default is the host
byte order).  If no \f3-c\f1 or \f3-x\f1 option is given, output is in
the same encoding as the input document.
.TP
\f3-D \f2name\f1 \f2sysid\f1
Force use of the document type specified by \f2sysid\f1.  The root element name
for validation is \f2name\f1.  Any DTD in the document is ignored.  This flag
does not imply validation; use \f3-V\f1 if required.
.TP
.B -i
Do xml:id processing.  Attributes named xml:id are recognised as IDs even if not
declared.
.TP
.B -I
The same as \f3-i\f1, but in addition xml:id attributes are checked for uniqueness.
.TP
.B -z
Use a shorter format for error messages.  Particularly useful when using
the parser in Emacs compilation mode, so that Emacs can find the
error location.
.SH EXIT STATUS
If the \f3-V\f1 flag is given, and the document is well-formed but
not valid, 2 is returned.  If the document is not well-formed, or a
system error occurs, 1 is returned.  Otherwise 0 is returned.
Since the parser can expand external entities even when not validating,
it treats certain errors which are technically validity errors
as well-formedness errors.  If \f3-x\f1 is not specified, some
well-formedness errors produce only warnings and do not affect the
exit status.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
If the environment variable
.B XML_CATALOG_FILES
is set, XML catalog processing is enabled.
The variable should be set to a space-separated list of catalog
files.  The variable
.B XML_CATALOG_PREFER
may be set to \f3public\f1 or \f3system\f1 to
set the initial mode for catalog processing; the default is \f3system\f1.

If the variable
.B RXPURL is set, it is used as the URL of the document to parse.  This may
be useful in CGI scripts and the like to avoid shell parsing of a
user-supplied argument.

The variable
.B http_proxy
can be used to specify a proxy for HTTP connections.  The syntax
is \f3hostname[:port]\f1.
