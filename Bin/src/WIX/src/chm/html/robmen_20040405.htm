<h1><a href='http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/04/05/107709.aspx'>Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset has released as Open Source on SourceForge.net</a></h1>
<P>The <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix">Windows Installer Xml (WiX) toolset</A> (pronounced &#8220;wicks toolset&#8221;) appears to have finished propagating around the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</A> CVS servers, so I can finally start writing this blog entry.&nbsp; As promised in my blog <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2003/12/23/56517.aspx">here</A>, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/02/03/66535.aspx">here</A>, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/02/05/68303.aspx">here</A>, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/03/06/85072.aspx">here</A>, and <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/03/16/90307.aspx">here</A> the WiX toolset and all of its source code has been released so that you can build Windows Installer databases (MSI and MSM files) the same way most groups inside <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A> do.&nbsp; However, a <A href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0060438">funny thing happened</A> on the way to the <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/">forum</A>.&nbsp; WiX became the first project from Microsoft to be released under an <A href="http://opensource.org/licenses/">OSS approved license</A>, namely the <A href="http://opensource.org/licenses/cpl.php">Common Public License</A>.</P>
<P>Before everyone gets sidetracked by the Open Source implications, let&#8217;s talk about exactly what WiX is.&nbsp; WiX is a toolset composed of a compiler, a linker, a lib tool and a decompiler.&nbsp; The compiler, called candle, is used to compile XML source code into object files that contain symbols and references to symbols.&nbsp; The linker, called light, is fed one or more object files and links the references in the object files to the appropriate symbols in other object files.&nbsp; Light is also responsible for collecting all of the binaries, packaging them appropriately, and generating the final MSI or MSM file.&nbsp; The lib tool, called lit, is an optional tool that can be used to combine multiple object files into libraries that can be consumed by light.&nbsp; Finally, the decompiler, called dark, can take existing MSI and MSM files and generate XML source code that represents the package.</P>
<P>So, let me step through a real quick example before sending you off to the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix">SourceForge project</A> to get the binaries and source code.&nbsp; First, the below is a complete source file that will create a MSI file that installs a test .NET Assembly into the &#8220;Program Files\Test Assembly&#8221; directory.</P><PRE>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;Wix xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2003/01/wi'&gt;

<P>I&#8217;ll discuss more complicated examples in future blog entries and update the documentation (WiX.chm) by distilling any discussions here.&nbsp; While we&#8217;re on the topic of documentation, let&#8217;s discuss where WiX is in its product life-cycle.</P>
<P>First of all, I would say that the WiX toolset is pretty close to Beta2 quality.&nbsp; That means core scenarios (compiling/linking) are very solid, less core scenarios (lib&#8217;ing/decompiling) still have some bugs, and the documentation leaves much to be desired.&nbsp; Part of my motivation for pushing the toolset external to Microsoft is to encourage me (and maybe find others) to update the documentation.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll talk more about that in future blog entries.</P>
<P>That said production quality MSI and MSM files can be produced from the WiX toolset today.&nbsp; Internally, teams such as <A href="http://office.microsoft.com/">Office</A>, <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/">SQL Server</A>, <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/biztalk/">BizTalk</A>, <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/virtualpc/">Virtual PC</A>, <A href="http://messenger.msn.com/Default.aspx">Instant Messenger</A>, several <A href="http://www.msn.com/">msn.com properties</A>, and many others use WiX to build their MSI and MSM files today.&nbsp; When someone encounters a bug, the community tracks the issue down and fixes it.&nbsp; Now, via <A href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</A>, you have an opportunity to be a part of the community as well.</P>
<P>Now, let&#8217;s talk about why WiX was released as Open Source.&nbsp; First, working on WiX has never been a part of my job description or review goals.&nbsp; I work on the project in my free time.&nbsp; Second, WiX is a very developer oriented project and thus providing source code access increases the pool of available developers.&nbsp; Today, there are five core developers (Robert, K, Reid, and Derek, thank you!) regularly working on WiX in their free time with another ten submitting fixes occasionally.&nbsp; Finally, many parts of the Open Source development process appeal to me. &nbsp;Back in 1999 and 2000, I did not feel that many people inside Microsoft understood what the Open Source community was really about and I wanted to improve that understanding by providing an example.</P>
<P>After four and a half years of part-time development, the WiX design (and most of the code) matured to a point where I was comfortable trying to release it externally.&nbsp; So, last October I started looking for a means to release not only the tools but the source code as well.&nbsp; I thought <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/">GotDotNet</A> was the place.&nbsp; However, at that time, none of the existing <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/Licensing/default.mspx">Shared Source licenses</A> were flexible enough to accept contributions from the community.&nbsp; Then, in February, I was introduced to <A href="http://www.osbc2004.com/speakers_stephen_walli.html">Stephen Walli</A> who was also working to improve Microsoft&#8217;s relationship with the Open Source community.&nbsp; Fortunately, Stephen was much farther along than I and had the step-by-step plan how to release an Open Source project from Microsoft using an approved OSS license.</P>
<P>Today, via <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix">WiX on SourceForge</A>, you get to see the results of many people&#8217;s efforts to improve Microsoft from the inside out.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not exactly sure what is going to happen next but I&#8217;m sure there are quite a few people who are interested to see where this leads.&nbsp; Personally, all I hope is that if you find the WiX toolset useful then you&#8217;ll join the community and help us improve the toolset.</P>
