<title>So you want to be a Windows Installer XML developer?</title>

<h1><a href='http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/04/14/112970.aspx'>So you want to be a Windows Installer XML developer?</a></h1>

<P>People have started expressing interest in joining the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix">Windows Installer XML toolset</A> development community so I figured I should get some administrative details out of the way.&nbsp; If you are interested in contributing code to the Windows Installer XML toolset, it is very important to read through all four of these topics.</P>
<P><B>1)&nbsp; The Windows Installer XML toolset copyright is held by <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>.</B></P>
<P>I want to be very up front about the copyright of the Windows Installer XML toolset and how it affects us as developers.&nbsp; Microsoft is the sponsor of the Windows Installer XML project.&nbsp; Before a contribution can be accepted into the WiX project, the lawyers have asked that we assign our rights to those contributions to Microsoft.&nbsp; By having developers sign a copyright assignment agreement, Microsoft can maintain single legal control of the project.&nbsp; That single legal control enables Microsoft to best defend the project in the future if there was ever any sort of legal challenge.</P>
<P>Before jumping to any conspiracy theories, please note that this copyright assignment is exactly the same process the <A href="http://www.gnu.org/fsf/fsf.html">Free Software Foundation</A> has you go through if you work on a project they sponsor.&nbsp; Also, in Clause 5 of the Windows Installer XML assignment agreement your rights to your contribution are explicitly granted back to you.&nbsp; If you would like a copy of the assignment agreement, please contact <A href="mailto:wixadmin@microsoft.com">wixadmin@microsoft.com</A>.</P>
<P><B>2)&nbsp; The Windows Installer XML project is a <A href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?BenevolentDictator">benevolent dictatorship</A>.</B></P>
<P>In order to ensure consistency in the schema and maintain the quality of the tools, the Windows Installer XML project&#8217;s CVS tree is locked down.&nbsp; In other words, commits to the code-base by the general populace are prevented.&nbsp; If you attempt commit changes, CVS will inform you that you have "Insufficient Karma to complete the task."</P>
<P>To have your contribution submitted to the project, please submit an assignment agreement as described above (you only need to do so once) then send your code diff to <A href="mailto:WiX-devs@lists.sourceforge.net">WiX-devs@lists.sourceforge.net</A>.&nbsp; The developers there will review the changes and someone will apply them to CVS as quickly as possible.</P>
<P><B>3)&nbsp; The Windows Installer XML community is a <A href="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/meritocracy.html">meritocracy</A>.</B></P>
<P>Those individuals in the community who demonstrate an understanding of the code base by actively participating on the <A href="mailto:WiX_users@lists.sourceforge.net">Windows Installer XML mailing lists</A> and consistently submitting high quality diffs will be given a &#8220;Karma boost&#8221;.&nbsp; With enough Karma you will earn the ability to commit changes directly to the Windows Installer XML project&#8217;s CVS tree.</P>
<P>Commit privileges should not be taken lightly.&nbsp; It is very important that the WiX toolset maintain a high quality bar because many people depend on the tools working properly.&nbsp; Very few developers earn these privileges.&nbsp; In fact, in over four years of development, only five developers have earned commit privileges to the internal Windows Installer XML project.</P>
<P><B>4)&nbsp; The Windows Installer XML developers are all <A href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=15112&amp;lastnode_id=357933">volunteers</A>.</B></P>
<P>Everyone (to the best of my knowledge) that works on the Windows Installer XML toolset does so in his or her free time.&nbsp; Please keep that fact in mind when asking for help, submitting code diffs, or interacting with any members of the project.&nbsp; We all want to help to make the Windows Installer XML toolset as solid a tool as possible, but sometimes &#8220;real jobs&#8221; and &#8220;significant others&#8221; have to take a higher precedence.</P>
<P>If worse comes to worse, you have access to the source code.&nbsp; Try reading for a while. :)</P>
