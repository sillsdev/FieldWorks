<h1>Using the Server Custom Actions</h1>

<p>
The wix toolset contains a library of custom actions.  The centerpiece of this
library is the server custom action set.  The server custom actions extend the
set of resources that an MSI can install to include things such as web sites,
file shares, user accounts, and many others.  These custom actions properly
associate these resources with components, and follow all the rules to properly
install, uninstall and rollback the installation or uninstallation of these
resources as part of their associated components.  This document will outline
their use with some examples.
</p>

<p>
This document assumes that the reader has an understanding of MSI custom action
types, and has read "WiX Overview" and "Writing in WiX".
</p>

<h2>Server Custom Action building blocks</h2>

<p>
With each release of the wix toolset, the files scasched.dll, scaexec.dll and
sca.wixlib are released.  The two dll files are the custom action dlls which
export the custom action entry points for all of the server custom actions.
When you build an MSI that makes use of the server custom actions, they end
up in the Binary table of the MSI.  The sca.wixlib contains a system of wix
fragments that you can link against to ensure that all of the proper error
messages, custom action records, and binary records get linked into your
final MSI.
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to incorporate the server custom actions into your MSIs is
to copy the sca.wixlib and the two custom action dlls (scasched.dll and
scaexec.dll) into a folder in your build environment.  It is not important
where this directory is, it is only important that the wixlib and the dlls
are in the same directory.  When you link your MSI using light.exe, you simply
need to include the full path to sca.wixlib in the list of wixobjs and wixlibs
you're linking.
</p>

<h2>Basic Example</h2>

<p>
First lets try an example that creates a user account when the MSI is installed.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;Wix xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2003/01/wi'&gt;
	&lt;Product Id='PutGuidHere' Name='TestUserProduct' Language='1033' Version='0.0.0.0'&gt;
		&lt;Package Id='PUT-GUID-HERE' Description='Test User Package' InstallerVersion='200' Compressed='yes' /&gt;
			&lt;Directory Id='TARGETDIR' Name='SourceDir'&gt;
				&lt;Component Id='TestUserProductComponent' Guid='PutGuidHere'&gt;
					&lt;User Id='TEST_USER1' Name='testName1' Password='pa$$word'/&gt;
				&lt;/Component&gt;
		&lt;/Directory&gt;

		&lt;Feature Id='TestUserProductFeature' Title='Test User Product Feature' Level='1'&gt;
			&lt;ComponentRef Id='TestUserProductComponent' /&gt;
		&lt;/Feature&gt;
	&lt;/Product&gt;
&lt;/Wix&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This is a simple example that will create a new user on the machine called "testName1"
with the password "pa$$word".  To build the MSI from this wix authoring first put the
above code in a file (remember to replace the "PUT-GUID-HERE" attributes with real GUIDs),
run 'candle.exe yourfile.wxs', and then run 'light.exe –out yourfile.msi yourfile.wixout
sca.wixlib' (replacing sca.wixlib with the full path to sca.wixlib).  Now use Orca to
open up the resulting msi and take a look at the Error table, the CustomAction table,
and the Binary table.  You will notice that all of the relevant data for managing users
has been "linked" into the MSI.  This happened because you have done two key things.
First, you made use of a &lt;User/&gt; element under a &lt;Component/&gt; element which indicates
that a user is to be installed as part of the MSI package, and second, you linked with
the sca.wixlib.  Compiler support, along with the system of fragments that exist in the
sca.wixlib ensure that only the data associated with the elements you used in your wxs
file are "linked" into the MSI.
</p>

<h2>The server custom action elements</h2>

<p>
In the previous example you learned that by using the &lt;User/&gt; element in your WiX authoring
and then linking with the sca.wixlib that all of the relevant custom actions, error messages,
and binary table rows were brought in automatically.  The wix compiler contains support for
automatically referencing the appropriate symbols in the sca.wixlib when you make use of
specific elements such as &lt;User/&gt;.  As stated in the introduction the server custom actions
add the ability to install many new types of resources.  Each of these resource types has
one or more elements that allow you to install them with your MSI package.  If you're using
the sca.wixlib, the only things you need to know are the appropriate elements for the
resources you want to install.  Here is a listing of the different resource types that the
server custom actions are able to install and the elements that control their installation:

<ul>
<li>Web Sites - &lt;WebSite/&gt;</li>
<li>Web Applications - &lt;WebApplication/&gt;</li>
<li>Certificates - &lt;Certificate/&gt;</li>
<li>SQL databases - &lt;SqlDatabase/&gt;</li>
<li>SQL scripts - &lt;SqlScript/&gt;</li>
<li>SQL strings - &lt;SqlString/&gt;</li>
<li>Users - &lt;User/&gt;</li>
<li>FileShares - &lt;FileShare/&gt;</li>
<li>Perfmon Counter registration - &lt;PerfCounter/&gt;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
By using the appropriate elements from this table in your wix authoring and by linking with
sca.wixlib, you will ensure that you are properly using the wix server custom actions.
