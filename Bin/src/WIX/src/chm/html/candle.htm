<h1>Compiler (candle)</h1>
<p>
The Windows Installer XML compiler is exposed by candle.exe.  candle is responsible for preprocessing the input .wxs files into valid well-formed XML documents against the WiX schema, wix.xsd.  Then, each post-processed source file is compiled into a .wixobj file.
</p>
<p>
The compilation process is relatively straight forward.  The WiX schema lends itself to a simple recursive descent parser.  The compiler processes each element in turn creating new symbols, calculating the necessary references and generating the raw data for the .wixobj file.
</p>
<p>
The second version of candle is not significantly different from the first implementation.  Any changes were either made to enable the new symbol/reference linking or based on feedback from customers.  Some of the differences between versions include:  the new object file format is XML instead of MSI, modularization of primary keys now happens at link time, and binary streams are imported at link time.
