JRock: Integrated all of the Vs2005 test projects from wix to wix20.

JRock: Massive Votive rework and bug fixing. This brings Votive to the most
	   stable release to date. Extensive testing was done on both Visual
	   Studio 2003 and 2005. Also, some new features were added.
	   - SFBUG:1457689 - Project does not build in VS 2005
	   - SFBUG:1418194 - Unable to build UI installers with votive
	   - SFBUG:1407291 - Errors when delete file from a WiX project
	   - SFBUG:1402552 - space in RelativeOutputDirectory produces error
	   - SFBUG:1374561 - Problems creating WiX Project in VS 2005
	   - SFBUG:1357724 - votive preprocessor should replace "." in project names
	   - SFBUG:1277228 - Rename causes assertion failure
	   - SFBUG:1245805 - Error: Invalid pointer
	   - SFBUG:1244159 - Rename files in Votive causes incorrect UI
	   - SFBUG:1240565 - Adding a new file to Votive in VS 2005 Beta 2 fails
	   - SFBUG:1237410 - Another project is already building. Please cancel that
						 build
	   - SFBUG:1234899 - Error dialog displayed when selecting a file
	   - SFBUG:1232582 - Directory support in votive projects
	   - SFBUG:1212472 - Incremental building
	   - SFBUG:1183029 - Project Build/Rebuild not implemented
	   - SFBUG:1176499 - double clicking on the file gives error
	   - SFBUG:1124165 - "The parameter is incorrect"
	   - Feature       - Added an optional RelativeIntermediateDirectory
						 attribute to the <Configuration> section of the wixproj
						 file. This allows for a directory to put the .wixobj
						 files so they aren't in the same directory as the
						 project output. Existing .wixproj files are still valid
						 without this attribute.
	   - Feature       - Added support for the -loc flag for light.exe. All of
						 the .wxl files in the project will be used in the link
						 phase.
	   - Feature       - Incremental build now works!! Also, the Clean, Build,
						 and Rebuild menu items work for WiX projects in both
						 VS 2003 and VS 2005. Interesting note, VS 2005 changed
						 the way it builds projects by adding support for
						 querying for project up-to-date status. In my
						 implementation of the interface, I was returning S_OK,
						 which indicates that the project is up-to-date and
						 doesn't need to be rebuilt. Consequently, VS never
						 called into me to build. It turns out that I have to
						 actually return E_FAIL to indicate that the project is
						 out of date. How in the heck am I supposed to know
						 that!! It's not documented anywhere. I only found out
						 by looking at the CPP hierarchy project that ships with
						 the SDK. Go figure.

DerekC: Use the proper file names for *.exe.config files in Votive setup.

BobArnso: Add -NXCOMPAT, -SafeSEH, and -hotpatch switches for all C++ projects

JRock: - SFBUG:1350404 - Deleting Wix Reference deletes the underlining Wixlib file
	   - SFBUG:1237769 - References in votive

JRock: - SFBUG:1244659 - Assertion Failed: The collection is read-only
	   - SFBUG:1221801 - If project does not load, context menu is wrong.

RobMcInt: Add Print functionality to the license dialogs.

Chilbert: Fix a bug where formatted registry keys caused a failure in the
		  SecureObject custom action.  Couldn't set permissions on the
		  registry key.  Just needed to format the data that is pulled from
		  the Registry table.  Also fixed aclutil.cpp so that CREATOR OWNER
		  common sid actually sets up the appropriate ACL

BobArnso: Deliver PDB and source .zips as well as binaries

BobArnso: Fix ICE validation in Votive.msi and WixUI qtests

JRock: Added property page support for WiX projects! Only one page is
	   implemented right now. More to come. It only works in VS 2005,
	   however. This is probably the start of a VS 2003/2005 separation. I've
	   been running into too many little discrepancies that is really draining
	   my time and it's getting too cumbersome to support two different versions
	   of Visual Studio simultaneously since testing has to be done twice. The
	   code base between the two versions is still identical, however, and will
	   probably continue to be so as long as its feasible.

RobMen: Fix race condition when multiple processes build cabinets at the same
		time.

DerekC: Convert all WiX xml files to 4-space indentation.

BobArnso: Change zipping to zip explicit file extensions rather than whole
		  trees. That lets us build WiX using WiX.sln (which puts the binaries
		  relative to the source) without cluttering up the sources .zip file.

DerekC: SFBUG:1476404 - Exception with -ust option

BobArnso: Don't include .cub files in the sources .zip file

BobArnso: Fix WixUI loc bugs by resizing various text fields:
		  SFBUG:1469187, SFBUG:1469191, SFBUG:1469194

BobArnso: Skip strong-name-verification-skipping if the pubic-key token is
		  already listed (so once it's listed, the build runs as a normal,
		  limited user rather than requiring admin rights).

DerekC: SFBUG:1477225 - Duplicate symbol found when using wixui and wixca
		libraries

DerekC: Merging fixes:
		- SFBUG1446323 - Conflict using MSMs and Suppress Sequence Tables
		- Suppression of an individual action from an already suppressed table
		  results in an uncaught exception.

BobArnso: Updated WiX.chm with recent WixUI changes

DerekC: SFBUG:1122555 - Support localization of control sizes and positions

ScotK,AviPi: Use short paths for PerfMon to avoid localization issues with long
			 paths.

BobArnso: - Change WixUI_InstallDir to support path-setting directly in
			InstallDirDlg (without needing to click Change) [Note that this
			change impacts loc strings]
		  - Swap OK and Cancel button locations in BrowseDlg
		  - Add a PropertyRef so error occurs if you use WixUI_InstallDir
			without setting WIXUI_INSTALLDIR property

DerekC: Fix qtests so they will stop looking for files in the WiX 3.0 branch.

a-TsunH: Updated ProgressDlg.wxs to display title and text in minor upgrade.

BobArnso: Add support for Windows 2003 R2 Platform SDK

FreGro: SFBUG:1438209 - Infinite loop in ConfigureComPlusUninstall
		SFBUG:1420636 - Null pointer reference in com+ custom action
		MSMQ CustomActions now always grants the local Administrators group
						all permisions for a newly created queue.

DerekC: - Prevent an exception from being thrown for merge modules without an
		  embedded cabinet.
		- Allow SqlScript/@BinaryKey to ommitted (to support a Binary child
		  element).  This authoring is actually disallowed in WiX 3.0 - but we
		  need to keep supporting it in 2.0 because some groups may be running
		  the compiler with schema suppression enabled (so this authoring works
		  for them, even though its unsupported by the schema).

DerekC: SFBUG:1511706 - ODBCDriver fails in merge modules

BobArnso: Add SDK subdirectory to binaries .zip to include MsgGen and
		  DocCompiler so you can build extensions without WiX sources.
		  Headers and libraries live there too.

RobMen: Add verbose message for when cabinets are streamed into MSI.

DerekC: Parse Property/@Id as an identifier.

DerekC: Correct several incorrect forms of the null guid which may break merge
		modules from properly resolving feature links when merged.

DerekC: Add support for later MSI 4.0 features.

DerekC: - SFBUG:1539986 - Merge module row generation bug
		- Enforce ModuleSignature.ModuleID as an identifier value

DerekC: Don't modularize the NetFxExecuteNativeImageCommit custom action.

DerekC: SFBUG:1543994 - candle -ust fails for Shortcut

DerekC: SFBUG:1544057 - Patchgroup attribute causes installation to fail

BobArnso: Fix bug in WixUI_InstallDir so that SetTargetPath is called,
		  updating child directories of WIXUI_INSTALLDIR. (Without it,
		  only the one directory is updated; children retain the original
		  structure as defined by the Directory table.)

DerekC: SFBUG:1548526 - Column/@Category="Template" changes to "Formatted"

LeeTh: Fixed bug in SchedServiceConfig where we were writing rollback CA data
	   into the CA data buffer, causing the first service instaled to be
	   misconfigured and any subsequent services to cause an install failure.

RobMen: SFBUG:1510473 - fix invalid strings in Dutch .wxl file

RobMen: SFBUG:1496774 - remove uk-ua .wxl that isn't ready

FreGro: SFBUG:1487586 - Adding component to COM+ if it is in the GAC

PMarcu: SFBUG:1427460 - SqlScript without SqlDb should generate compiler error

RobMen: SFBUG:1591591;SFBUG:1213273 - ConfigureIIs now handles IIS6-only
					  features (like AppPool and WebServicExtension) on IIS5
					  if IIS6 Components are conditionalized out correctly.

RobMen: Fix Certificate and SSL install.

RobMen: IIsWebSiteCertificate table is optional, don't fail with fatal error
		if it can't be found.
